## Uebersicht
CoinTracking calls itself the leader in cryptocurrency reporting and tracking, and with over 1.4 million clients, including more than 25,000 corporate clients and CPAs, they might not be wrong. We recently did a deep dive into CoinTracking and can say that we were surprised and delighted with how robust and comprehensive this tax tool really is, making it clear why it is trusted by so many tax professionals, firms, and retail users, including some members here at Coin Bureau HQ. 

CoinTracking is particularly detailed, and users will know exactly how their portfolio is performing, how diversified they are, and what their tax burden is going to be throughout the year. We found that along with CoinTracking being a great tax tool, it also offers one of the most powerful portfolio tracking tools we've used, and the best part, at no additional cost. The reporting and analytics section of CoinTracking is second to none.

CoinTracking has a web-based solution that allows for the easy connection to exchanges via an API, or through CSV files. This allows CoinTracking to display the complete trading history of a user and determine profits, losses, and taxes owed in real-time. Final reports can be generated in a number of formats, including CSV, PDF, XLS, XML, and JSON.

The platform aggregates all of the transactions made through the connected accounts, showing exactly what was sent or received, and the exact trades made over the course of the year. CoinTracking can help with:

Personal analysis: 25 customizable crypto reports to show things like profit/loss, audit reports, realized/unrealized gains etc.
Easy imports from 110+ exchanges, automatic import and direct syncs.
Tax declaration for over 100 countries supported for filing capital gains, income, mining, business operations tax and more.
Tax Advice- A team of tax advisors to help with tax queries and perform tax reviews.
We found CoinTracking to have among the best country and fiat support, including the most robust network of tax professionals available in 75 countries for users to contact.

The platform also shows the historical coin prices at the time the trades were made and has over 12 years of data on more than 26,000 coins.

CoinTracking has positioned itself to be suitable for individual hodlers, traders, institutions, and companies. Like the other mentions on this list, users can enjoy limited functions for free, or choose one of the paid plans as you can see here:

For pricing, we found CoinTracking to offer the most value out of the competition for their free plan and the best-priced option for users with between 1,000 to 3,500 transactions. This platform also becomes the best-priced option (by quite a significant margin) for anyone who needs to import over 100k transactions or anyone needing unlimited transaction support.

One of the requirements for any platform to make it in this article is that they have to have positive reviews and a good reputation, and CoinTracking is no exception. These guys have some raving reviews from the likes of Forbes, Nasdaq, CNN, Bitcoin.com, CNBC, plus ourselves here at the Bureau and more, so users can sleep well at night knowing their taxes are being done accurately with CoinTracking.

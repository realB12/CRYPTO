# Oracle (Blockchain)

-> siehe auch [Real World Assets](../R/RWA.md)

Blockchain oracles are entities that **connect blockchains to external, real world systems**, thereby enabling smart contracts to execute based upon inputs and outputs from the real world.

[ChainLink (LINK)](../../TOKENS/C/ChainLink.md) ist z.B. einer der führenden Anbieter in diesem Bereich.  

Oracles play a foundational role in the creation of the verifiable web, connecting blockchains that would otherwise be isolated to offchain data and compute, and enabling interoperability between blockchains. Initially, oracle networks enabled the creation of the DeFi space and then become an industry standard solution for all of Web3.

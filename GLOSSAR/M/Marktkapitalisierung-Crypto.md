# Marktkapitalisierung für Cryptos
Market Cap is the total value of a cryptocurrency, calculated by multiplying the current price of one coin by the total number of coins in circulation. It's a snapshot of the coin's overall value, **not the amount of money that has been invested or is currently in the market**. 

However it is the nature of the market that market cap and available money on the side-line that is free to invest have a dependency and therefore will somehow correlate - not in mathematical terms, but within boundaries that is defined by common sense.

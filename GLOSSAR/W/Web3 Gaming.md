# Web3 Online Gaming

Overall, the sentiment for web3 gaming appeared high. This is despite everyone seemingly being aware that the industry still has a long way to go to achieve legitimacy outside of web3-native gamers. But, to quote the words of a wise man, “Web3 Gaming is Inevitable."

Seems that W3Gaming is pumping ETH layet 2 network as for instance [Yield Guild Game’s (YGG)](https://www.yieldguild.io/) launching of its "Onchain Guilds platform" on Coinbase’s Ethereum layer 2 network Base. 

(YGG’s Onchain Guilds platform allows web3 gaming communities to build an onchain record of their gaming achievements. This is expected to play a huge role in helping the best or even newer teams get better opportunities, including early play testing, sponsorships, etc.)

Philippines has managed to retain its reputation as the web3 gaming capital of the world. Notably, the country’s relatively low cost of living encouraged many Filipino youngsters to make a living playing play-to-earn games like Axie Infinity during the last crypto market cycle. While such earnings from web3 games have long since disappeared, the country has managed to retain a good portion of its web3 gamer base. The only difference now is that most web3 gamers in the Philippines either play competitively as esport athletes for web3 games like Parallel, or are content creators helping push marketing efforts for partnered projects of larger guild organisations like YGG and YGG Pilipinas. Notably, this has changed the quality of life for many younger Filipinos.

The web3 gaming industry is taking huge strides to look and feel like regular gaming. One of the overarching sentiments from project founders at the conference was that they wanted web3 gaming to be as normalised as web2 gaming. They preferred referring to themselves as ‘gaming’ projects instead of ‘web3’ gaming projects.However it seems that currently therea are no ‘gamers’ but only ‘farmers’ in web3 - hinting at the trend of web3 gamers jumping from one game to the next with the goal of farming airdrops as efficiently as possible.

On the other end of the spectrum, web3 gaming projects are trying to bring web2 players into their games by replicating familiar experiences. These include projects trying to replicate what Steam and Epic Games have done for PC games. In fact, we saw three projects within this category - HyperPlay, Eragon and B3 (bsmnt.fun)

Most of the projects within this category are building chain-agnostic marketplaces for web3 games. B3 (aka BSMNT) in particular claimed it offered better distribution for games on its platform by encouraging games to refer their player base to explore other games in the ecosystem through cleverly-aligned incentives. Essentially, any game on BSMNT that refers its players to another game earns royalties paid in B3 tokens from the other game. It calls this incentive program B3 Open Gaming.

Third, Telegram mini apps appear to be gaining some serious traction within the game developer community.

Almost every game that showcased at the expo this week had a Telegram mini-app version. Projects either went direct to Telegram or ported a version of their browser game there. Many of the founders our researcher spoke to during the conference acknowledged that Telegram mini-games were the best form of distribution for getting new users into their ecosystem/IP.

Games porting over to Telegram have realised that they have a reliable revenue stream from micro-transactions paid via Telegram Stars or TON. In fact, Mantle appears to be one of the Ethereum ecosystem chains especially bullish on the potential of Telegram mini games. Specifically, the Mantle team appears to have bet on Catizen as their main driving force in Telegram mini game adoption. They also claim 20+ Telegram games from the Mantle ecosystem will launch in the next few quarters.

There are two ecosystems that appear to hold the most promise: Avalanche and XAI. In fact, a large portion of the games preparing to launch next year are building on Avalanche subnets, Off The Grid being the first major example. As for XAI, the ecosystem has been slow to launch. However, the primary reason for this appears to be regulatory due diligence.

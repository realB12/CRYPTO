# Relative Strength Index (RSI)
The RSI **indicates OverSold and Overbaugt Signals** by measuring the <u>short-term</u> momentum of the markt by measuring the pace and direction of recent price moves. 

## How do you read the RSI? 
The RSI-line oscillates in a channel with the top signaling an over- and the bottom an undersold. This channel is normally plotted under the price-chart.

A cryptocurrency is **oversold** when it has persistent sell pressure and the RSI indicates it’s set to rally upwards. 

Inversely, it’s **overbought** when the cryptocurrency has been heavily bought and the RSI shows it’s due for a downward correction. 

It’s most useful to analyse the RSI over a period of a few weeks, although looking at longer time frames can help you see how well the RSI has been indicating price changes for a particular cryptocurrency.

## When is the market overbought and oversold?
An RSI below 30 (oversold) indicates a an up-trend  and an RSI above 70 is considered a down-trend to happen soon. 

Depending on the asset type RSI levels of 30 and 70 aren’t good enough and 20 and 80 can be more useful. 

Looking at the RSI compared to price over longer timeframes will help give you an idea of the right levels to use and the amount of time till the trends sets in once the signal is clear. 

It’s often a good idea to use different RSI levels for bear or bull markets. 

In a bull market we read signals at 40 and 90 whereas in the bear market we look for 10 adn 60 

Further, the stronger the market the stronger the probability that the price keeps moving higher in an RSI indicated overbought market. 

## How to calculate the RSI? 
RSI calculatoin is quite complex as the RSI is calculated using average price gains and losses over a given period of time. 

Here’s the RSI formula:

RSI = 100 – [100 / (1 + (Average gain of n days the market closed up  / Average loss of n days the market closed down)]

## How to use the RSI when trading crypto?
### 1. Entry and exit for your trade
RSI can help inform traders when to buy low and sell high. For example, a trader may wait for the RSI to go above 70 to exit a position. Similarly, they could wait until the RSI is below 30 before entering a trade. Some traders see this as a way to get more crypto for their dollars.

### 2. Swing trading
Swing trading is when you trade between short-term price rises and declines. The RSI is one indicator used to signal when to buy and sell. For example, a trader may buy when the RSI crosses below 30 and then sell when it crosses above 70, then buy again when it crosses below 30. Of course, the trader can use short positions for the declines as well. 

### 3. Identify support and resistance levels
The RSI can help identify key areas of support and resistance before they’re visible using the price chart. Support is the price the market is struggling to dip below and resistance is the price the market is struggling to break above. And when used in combination with the price chart, the support and resistance zones can be much easier to identify. 

### 4. Bullish and bearish divergence
Bullish RSI divergence occurs when both the price is making higher lows and the RSI is making declining lows. If the RSI is also in the oversold territory, this is especially bullish. Bearing RSI divergence is the opposite. It occurs when the price is making higher highs and the RSI indicator is making lower highs. This can be a sell signal for some traders.

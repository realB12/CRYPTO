# Real World Assets (RWA)
The same blockchain tokenization-features can be applied to Real World Assets (RWA) like for instance land, real-estate, a piece of art, oil, gold, anything of value and as stablecoins prove - even $dollars.

Tokenizing traditional assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate not only makes them more accessible but also unlocks benefits unavailable off-chain. One key example is fractionalization - RWAs can be broken into smaller tokens, allowing smaller investors to gain part-ownership.

These possibilities have asset managers like BlackRock scrambling for RWAs, adding to their bullish potential

## Roadblocks
However, early attempts to bring RWAs onchain faced significant challenges and struggled to gain widespread adoption for several reasons:

## 1. Timing and Demand 
A well-functioning market requires a **sufficient number of participants**. At the time, however, the technology was not yet proven enough for institutional investors, and many early crypto adopters were either focused on aggressive speculation of highly volatile digitally native tokens or were simply happy to finally be able to hold their wealth in a stable source of value through stablecoins.

## 2. Lack of Utility. 
Beyond simply buying and holding, there were limited use cases for tokenized assets. Without a robust ecosystem to support lending, borrowing, trading, or yield generation, tokenized RWAs often became simply **digital representations of value without much practical purpose**. While the ability to ‘buy and hold’ does have inherent value, vibrant financial markets depend on the ability to dynamically deploy assets to create liquidity, generate returns, and facilitate transactions.

## Focus on Alternative Assets. 
Early tokenization efforts often targeted illiquid assets like loans and private funds, assuming that blockchain’s ability to enable fast, cheap settlement would improve their liquidity. However, liquidity in these assets is constrained not by technology but by deeper issues like information asymmetry, lack of fungibility, pricing challenges, and issuer resistance to liquid secondary markets. As a result, these efforts failed to gain significant traction.

For these reasons, tokenization efforts outside of stablecoins remained largely pilot exercises to demonstrate feasibility, so far.

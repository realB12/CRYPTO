# Blockchain
A blockchain is an immutable, transparent and often decentralised digital database. It’s a way of recording transactions so anyone can see them, but no one can change them. These databases are the underlying technology that makes crypto possible, but they can do so much more. 

While the technology existed before Bitcoin, Bitcoin (BTC) was the first example of blockchain as we know it today. It also put the technology to use, not just outlining it as a theoretical concept.

However: One of the most substantial barriers to widespread blockchain adoption is scalability, or a lack thereof.

## Physik
Man könnte sich eine Blockchain als eine Harddisk vorstellen auf der jeder [Block](../../b$/GLOSSAR/B/Block.md) als Datei gespeichert ist.

# Bullmarket (Bullenmarkt)
Uptrend, or Bull Market is a stage in the market cycle characterised by 
long-term, consistent rises in asset prices, driven by increasing investor 
confidence and a positive economic outlook. During this period, investors often 
increase the risk in their portfolios to capitalize on the upward momentum.

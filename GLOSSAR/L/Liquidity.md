# Liquidity
In its simplest terms, liquidity can be seen as the total amount of free available money that could be spent short term in a specific market.

And this makes "Levels of liquidity" one of the most important crypto market indicators for sell/buy decisions.

The two main types of liquidity are market liquidity and accounting liquidity.

Current, quick, and cash ratios are most commonly used to measure liquidity.

## What Is Liquidity in more detail?
Liquidity refers to the ease with which an asset or security can be converted into cash <u>without affecting its market price</u>. 

The most liquid asset of all is cash itself. Consequently, the availability of cash to make such conversions is the biggest influence on whether a market can move efficiently.

The more liquid an asset is, the easier and more efficient it is to turn it back into cash. **Less liquid assets take more time and may have a higher cost.**

### Market Liquidity
Market liquidity refers to the extent to which a market, such as a country’s stock market or a city’s real estate market, allows assets to be bought and sold at stable, transparent prices. 

If an exchange has a high volume of trade that is not dominated by selling, the price that a buyer offers per share (the bid price) and the price that the seller is willing to accept (the ask price) will be fairly close to each other.

Investors, then, will not have to give up unrealized gains for a quick sale. 

**When the spread between the bid and ask prices tightens, the market is more liquid; when it grows, the market instead becomes more illiquid.** 

## Accounting Liquidity
Accounting liquidity measures the ease with which an individual or company can meet their financial obligations with the liquid assets available to them—the ability to pay off debts as they come due.

In investment terms, assessing accounting liquidity means comparing liquid assets to current liabilities, or financial obligations that come due within one year.

There are several ratios that measure accounting liquidity, which differ in how strictly they define liquid assets. Analysts and investors use these to identify companies with strong liquidity. It is also considered a measure of depth.

## Why Is Liquidity Important?
If markets are not liquid, it becomes difficult to sell or convert assets or securities into cash. You may, for instance, own a very rare and valuable family heirloom appraised at $150,000. However, if there is not a market (i.e., no buyers) for your object, then it is irrelevant since nobody will pay anywhere close to its appraised value—it is very illiquid. It may even require hiring an auction house to act as a broker and track down potentially interested parties, which will take time and incur costs.

Liquid assets, however, can be easily and quickly sold for their full value and with little cost. Companies also must hold enough liquid assets to cover their short-term obligations like bills or payroll; otherwise, they could face a liquidity crisis, which could lead to bankruptcy.

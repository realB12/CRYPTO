# Unsicherheit
In retrospect, **Feburary disaster wasn’t crypto, not even macro but insecurity on politics and geopolitics.** 

Ever since Trump took office on January 20th, his administration has been rushing to implement changes both domestically and internationally. This has resulted in extreme uncertainty among investors, especially given Trump’s mixed messaging about things like tariffs.

**Uncertainty just so happens to be kryptonite for the markets. That’s because investors are always pricing in the future.** When there’s a global pandemic or a regional conflict, it initially throws the market offside because investors weren’t expecting it. After a few days or weeks though, investors start to understand what’s going on, making them certain enough to allocate again.

Whereas things like better crypto regulations or upcoming macro data are fairly easy to forecast, forecasting politics and geopolitics is exponentially more difficult. The result is that almost everyone has been getting it wrong, and investors are starting to keep cash on the sidelines instead of trying to guess whether Trump will actually implement tariffs or delay them again.

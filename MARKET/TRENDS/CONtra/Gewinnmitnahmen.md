# Gewinn-Mitnahmen (Taking Profits)
**- DRIVER**

Gewinnmitnahmen liegen in der Natur der Sache. 

Sie sind aber **nur mässig relevant**, weil diese Mitnahmen - mangels Alternativen - mit grosser Wahrscheinlichkeit wieder in Crypto investiert werden.

People taking their profits after a longer bull runs is natural and normally already priced in. 

And most of they money they have taken out will be reinvested again as soon as the upward trend is back. So in the long run, in a bullish environment only a few will take their money and will never come back (buying a house instead). 

So, for this two reasons and having a longterm perspective it is just a natural and quite static part of the game that does not need specific consideration.

# Europe on the decline

Europe needs a deep and liquid capital market. 

European household savings reach almost 1.4 trillion Euros, compared with just over 800 billion in the United States. 

But European companies struggle to tap into that and raise the funding they need, because our domestic Capital Market is fragmented, and because that pushes money overseas. 

300 billion euros of European Family Savings are invested abroad every year. 

And that's a key issue, holding back the growth of our tech startups and hindering our innovative clean-tech sector. 

**We do not lack capital but we lack an efficient capital market, that turns savings into investments!**, particularly for early stage technologies that have gamechanging potential.  

And this is why we will create a European savings and investments union with new European saving and investments products, new incentives for risk capital and a new push to ensure the seamless flow of investment across our union. 

We will **mobilize more capital to let Made-in-Europe innovation and risk-taking thrive**. 

...

Too much of our top talent is leaving the European Union because it's easier to grow their companies elsewhere, and far too many firms are holding back investment in Europe because of unnecessary "red tape". 
...
We will launch a far-reaching simplification of our sustainable finance and due diligence rules, and create a conducive environment for our SMEs to scale up their capacity to build, to produce and innovate in Europe. 

But the European Market still has too many national barriers. So sometimes companies are dealing with 27 different National legislations. 

**So we will offer instead, to innovative companies, to operate all across our European Union under one single set of rules**. We call it the "28th Regime".  Corporate law, insolvency labor law, taxation, ...: One single and simple framework across our Union. 

This will help bring down the most common barriers to scaling up all across Europe because Continental scale is our greatest asset in the world of giants. 

Before the start of Putin's War, Europe got of its gas supplies and 50% of its coal imports from Russia. Russia was also one of our largest oil suppliers. This energy appeared cheap, but it exposed us to Blackmail. So when Putin's tanks rolled into Ukraine, Putin cut us off his gas supplies and in return we substantially reduced our dependency on Russian fossil fuels in record time. 

Our gas imports from Russia went down by roughly 75% and now we import from Russia only 3% of our oil and no coal at all anymore. 

But Freedom came at a price where households and businesses saw sky-rocking energy costs and bills for many are yet to come down. Now our competitiveness depends on getting back to low and stable energy prices, where clean energy is the midterm answer because it is cheap, it creates good jobs here in the European Union, and it strengthens our energy independence. 

Already today Europe generates more electricity from wind and solar than from all fossil fuels combined, but we still have lots of work to do, to feed through these benefits to companies and people. 

Not only must we continue to diversify our energy supplies and expand clean sources of generation from renewables, and in some countries also from nuclear. 

We will have to invest in Next Generation Clean Energy Technologies like Fusion enhanced geothermal and solid state batteries. 

We must also **mobilize more private Capital to modernize our electricity grids and storage infrastructure**. We must remove the remaining barriers to our energy Union and we must better connect our clean and low carbon Energy Systems. 

All of this will be part of a new plan that we will present in February. 

It is time to complete our energy Union, so that clean power can run freely across our continent and bring pride down for all Europeans.

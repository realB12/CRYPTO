# The U.S. could accumulate up to 400,000 bitcoins in 2025
last update: 8.1.2025

The U.S. could accumulate up to 400,000 bitcoins in 2025 which could trigger a massive bull run and reshape global markets.


We are forecasting that the U.S. could accumulate between 300,000 and 400,000 bitcoins in 2025 as part of a strategic reserve, that could trigger a significant surge in BTC’s value.

This follows the introduction of Senator Cynthia Lummis’ Bitcoin Act of 2024, which proposes the acquisition of up to one million bitcoins over five years using Federal Reserve remittances. While the bill is still in its early stages and subject to political negotiations, we are confident that momentum from both retail and institutional investors could drive the U.S. to establish a substantial bitcoin reserve. 

The US will likely cement bitcoin as a cornerstone of its financial strategy, and this monumental decision will push bitcoin’s value to unprecedented levels.

This initiative is seen as part of a broader geopolitical strategy, suggesting that the accumulation of bitcoin could enhance U.S. economic positioning. “This is more than an economic initiative; it’s a geopolitical masterstroke. With this reserve, the U.S. not only strengthens its position as a crypto powerhouse but also secures the dollar’s relevance in an increasingly digital global economy,”


Although the full target of one million bitcoins may not materialize, the establishment of a reserve between 300,000 and 400,000 bitcoins would be enough to influence global markets, and the creation of a reserve of 300,000 to 400,000 bitcoins would likely trigger a bitcoin bull run of epic proportions, driving exponential value creation and reshaping financial markets.

While the Bitcoin Act remains under legislative consideration, Green views its introduction as indicative of a shift toward greater governmental acceptance of bitcoin. “As the Bitcoin Act progresses through the legislative process, it’s clear we’re entering a new financial era,” he concluded. Emphasizing the growing strategic importance of bitcoin, Green noted: “Bitcoin is no longer just a speculative asset. It is becoming a strategic tool for economic resilience and global competitiveness.”

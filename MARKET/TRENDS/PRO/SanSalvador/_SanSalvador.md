# San Salvador


## Conlusion


## Facts
San Salvador with a population of 6.3 million, became the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021 that obliged for instance businesses to accept BitCoin as a means of payment which has caused ongoing concerns from international organisations such as the IMF.

### History

#### `2024-12-19`: Salvador remains bullish
Post from Stacy Herbert (head bitcoin office): 

➡️Bitcoin remains legal tender

➡️El Salvador will continue buying bitcoin (at possibly an accelerated pace) for its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve

➡️Bitcoin capital markets will continue to be built; for example, the recent tokenized issuance of US Treasuries on Liquid via @NexBridgeSV

➡️The Bitcoin Office will continue building bitcoin policy and roadmaps, attracting investors and building education programs, including the new Grades 2 & 3 Little HODLer bitcoin and money workbooks for January 2025 

➡️CUBO+ continues educating elite bitcoin and Lightning devs talent in El Salvador; another group of more than 20 students will graduate at the end of January 2025

➡️Mi Primer Bitcoin and Node Nation continue being taught in high schools across El Salvador

#### `2024-12-19`: Chivo will be sold
Stacy Herbert, director of National Bitcoin Office stated that the Chivo wallet would ‘be sold or wound down’, adding that ‘many private sector bitcoin wallets will continue serving El Salvador’.

#### `2024-12-18`: El Salvador agrees with IMF to ‘confine’ Bitcoin use
As a condition of a new IMF loan package, President Bukele has to concede three aspects of the Bitcoin Law passed in 2021 to reduce "financial risk" claimed by IWF and other organisations:

1. A legal tender mandate **requiring businesses to accept Bitcoin**
2. **Shutting down Chivo**, the state run wallet and on/off ramp service
3. **No longer accepting tax payments in bitcoin** and pay in US$ again.

IMF said that it agrees on an ‘Extended Fund Facility’ (EFF) of about US$1.4 billion ‘to support the government’s reform agenda.’ The EFF provides financial assistance to nations facing ‘serious medium-term balance of payments problems because of structural weaknesses that require time to address’. On digital assets, the announcement states that ‘the potential risks of the Bitcoin project will be diminished significantly in line with Fund [IMF] policies.’  
Taxes will only be paid in US dollars and the El Salvador government’s participation in digital wallet Chivo will be ‘gradually unwound.’
The announcement states that ‘fiscal transparency is set to be substantially strengthened, starting with early efforts to enhance the fiscal responsibility framework, and to improve the reporting of debt, pension costs, state-owned enterprises ownership, procurement contracts and beneficiary ownership’.

It adds that ‘early reforms will also focus on establishing a strong anti-corruption framework and improving the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financial Terrorism (AML/CFT) arrangements in line with international best practices.’

## 2025 Outlook:  El Salvador Will Become Latam’s Crypto Hub
El Salvador is in the process of becoming a pioneer in the crypto industry in Latam. Just this last week, two crypto and tech-linked companies, [Thether](#thether) and [Rumble](#rumble) announced their entrance to the country.

As crypto becomes a larger part of the tech industry, encompassing tech giants like Google and Apple, more companies will appreciate the freedom of operating in an innovative environment like El Salvador.

While more nation-states are also moving in the direction of offering more clarity regarding crypto, El Salvador has something they don’t: a progressive government that welcomes innovation and has shown its willingness to work alongside crypto companies.

### Thether
Tether (USDT) announced moving its headquarters to El Salvador, praising the conditions offered by EL Salvador’s regulatory framework to crypto companies, stating that it would allow them to produce innovative products. This movement includes the construction of a skyscraper.

### Rumble
Rumble, a video distribution and cloud computing services company, also announced it would start hiring locally to open offices in El Salvador. This announcement comes after establishing a deal with the government to provide cloud computing services.

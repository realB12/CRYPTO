Donald Trump’s team launched the ‘Official Trump’ meme coin (ticker: $TRUMP (https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/official-trump/)) on January 18th - two days before the inauguration. The launch of the coin was wildly popular, with its market cap and FDV surging to all-time highs of $15 billion and $75 billion respectively. The kicker is that this insane rally happened in under 36 hours post launch. The only reason why the rally seemed to top out where it did was the subsequent launch of $MELANIA – a meme coin by First Lady Melania Trump. A controversial move to say the least.

# Crypto Adoption by Banks & Financial Advisers

## Banks allowed for CryptoBusiness
Under Trump the SEC has canceled SAB 121, an accounting rule which effectively prohibited banks from working with crypto. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan revealed in an interview (https://decrypt.co/302045/bank-america-ceo-banking-industry-ready-crypto) that the banking industry is ready to get involved in crypto in a big way once the regulations become clearer. It’s safe to assume that this was a direct reference to SAB 121.

## Convincing Financial Advisers
The adoption of cryptocurrency among financial advisers is steadily increasing as they recognize the benefits and opportunities that digital assets present. More and more advisers are incorporating cryptocurrencies into their investment portfolios for their clients, thereby diversifying their options and potentially increasing returns. This adoption is driven by a growing awareness of the potential of blockchain technology and the advantages it offers in terms of security, transparency, and efficiency. As financial advisers seek to provide the best possible service to their clients, many are turning to cryptocurrencies as a way to help them achieve their financial goals.

# Nationen setzen auf Crypto

Nachdem sich [SanSalvador](SanSalvador/_SanSalvador.md) bereits zum Crypto comitted hat und man im Kanton Zug (Schweiz) seine Steuern mit BTC begleichen kann, überlegen sich auch andere Staaten Cryptowährungen wie z.B. [Russland](#russland) und [Weissrussland](#weissrussland) als offizielles Zahlungsmittel einzuführen um unter anderem auch Sanktionen zu umgehen.

## Russland
Russia plans to do with the **digital ruble**, which is currently in its pilot phase. The State Duma recently profiled its use for sidestepping sanctions and improving state spending controls.

> The digital ruble is important for the state. Everything that is carried out within the framework of state and municipal procurement must go through the digital ruble, because the transparency of the digital ruble is 100%

## Weissrussland
According to BELTA, the official Belarusian news agency, Belarus President Lukaschenko has declared in January 2025:

> In Belarus, we are working on creating a cryptocurrency. We have surplus electricity.

stating that this is a joint task between IT specialists and the government and that they were also working on artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives.

“It suits us to make payments in cryptocurrency,” Lukashenko remarked. As an aide to Russia, Belarus also faces a flurry of **sanctions** complicating the settlement of international payments. In this sense, this digital currency might become a **tool to facilitate transnational trade**.

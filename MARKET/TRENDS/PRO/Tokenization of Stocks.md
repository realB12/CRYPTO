## Tokenization of stocks and bonds coming

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink noted in an interview (https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/01/23/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-i-want-the-sec-to-rapidly-approve-the-tokenization-of-bonds-and-stocks.html) that he wants the **SEC to “rapidly approve the tokenization of stocks and bonds”**. 

Given the changes in leadership at the SEC, it’s possible that the regulator will be able to do just that. This is more significant than you think, because BlackRock appears to have chosen Ethereum and its layer 2s for its RWAs.

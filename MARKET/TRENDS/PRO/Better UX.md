# Better UserExperience

UX will no longer be defined by the underlying tech, but real customer needs. Better interfaces will **increase adoption rates in general, but also when daily usage of crypto related services will become more relaxed for non-professinals.** 

While blockchain technical infrastructure is interesting and varied, many crypto companies aren’t just choosing their infrastructure — the infrastructure is in some ways choosing for them, and therefore their users, when it comes to UX (user experience). That’s because specific technical choices at the infrastructure level correlate directly with the resulting UX of a blockchain product/ service. 

But I believe the industry will overcome the ideological barrier implied here: That technology should decide the ultimate UX, vs. the other way around. In 2025, more crypto product designers will begin with the end-user experience they want, and then choose the appropriate infrastructure from there. Crypto startups no longer have to over-index on specific infrastructure decisions before finding product-market fit — they can focus on actually finding product-market fit. 

Instead of getting caught up in specific EIPs, wallet providers, intent architectures, etc., we can abstract away these choices into a holistic, full-stack, plug-and-play approach. The industry is ready for this: abundant programmable blockspace, maturing developer tooling, and chain abstraction are beginning to democratize who can design in crypto. Most technology end-users don’t care what language something is written in to use that product every day. The same will begin to happen in crypto.

# Pro Crypto US Regulations
The US court has overturned the sanctions on Tornado Cash (Tornado Cash is a privacy protocol on Ethereum that was sanctioned by the US government. The sanctions were unprecedented, as they basically marked the first time that a dApp was sanctioned, and its developers arrested for making it).

Even though the case against Tornado Cash’s developers is still technically ongoing, the overturning of the sanctions against it essentially means that crypto developers won’t have to worry about who is using their permissionless DeFi protocols. At the same time, it will make it much less scary for users who may fear accidentally interacting with sanctioned smart contracts (or having their wallets dusted with crypto connected to these sanctioned smart contracts).

This is excellent news for stablecoin issuers like Circle and Tether, who are waiting for the US government to pass reasonable stablecoin regulations.

Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said in an interview that he expects these stablecoin regulations to be passed by the end of the year ( https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/23/davos-crypto-execs-see-us-passing-crypto-laws-this-year-under-trump.html ). Once they are, we could see a new era of on-chain activity related to payments, savings, etc.

More importantly, all of these pro-crypto regulations are going to result in new methods of attracting users to their blockchains that were previously not allowed. 

One method we’ve been highlighting on the main channel is the possibility that wallets like Phantom could airdrop crypto to attract users. Phantom has denied airdrop rumors, but its backers ( https://cointelegraph.com/news/phantom-raises-150-million-3-billion-valuation ) presumably want an ROI.

Meanwhile, we’re likely to see different blockchains attract users by doing things like offering high yield savings accounts via stablecoins and DeFi protocols. The example that comes to mind here is Ethena’s plans to integrate with Telegram ( https://cryptoslate.com/ethena-reveals-roadmap-for-2025-eyes-telegram-payment-app/ ) for USDe stablecoin payments and savings. Note that the Ton Foundation recently underwent a leadership change to target the US market. (Toncoin is the blockchain used by Telegram, in case you didn’t know.)

Given these facts, the catalyst to keep your eyes peeled for over the next couple of weeks is any executive order or regulatory change that will formally allow US users to do things like use DeFi protocols and receive airdrops. For those unaware, Americans are currently blocked ( https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-airdrops-ban-u-users-144000980.html ) from many of these on-chain activities. When this change happens, it may initially feel like a nothing burger, like last week’s changes. But make no mistake, it will set the stage for a big rally

# Onboarding Capacity & Engagement Potential

**Only a few potential crypto users are  currently engaged whereas 98% of all users are either passive (600+ Mio) or not yet engaged at all (2-3 Mia).** 

I believe now is the time to re-engage the currently “passive” crypto holders and convert them into more active users, because only 5-10% of people owning crypto are actively using crypto. We can bring the 617 million people who already own crypto onchain — especially as blockchain infrastructure continues to improve, resulting in lower transaction fees for users. This means new applications will start to emerge for existing and new users. Meanwhile, the early applications we’ve already seen — across categories like stablecoins, DeFi, NFTs, gaming, social, DePIN, DAOs, and prediction markets — are starting to become more accessible to mainstream users as well, as the community focuses much more on user experience and other improvements.

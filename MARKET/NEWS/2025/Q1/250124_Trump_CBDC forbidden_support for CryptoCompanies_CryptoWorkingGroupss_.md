Trump ordered the **creation of a cryptocurrency working group** tasked with proposing **new digital asset regulations** and exploring the **creation of a national cryptocurrency stockpile**, making good on his promise to quickly overhaul U.S. crypto policy.

The much-anticipated action also ordered that banking services for crypto companies be protected, alluding to industry claims that U.S. regulators have directed lenders to cut crypto companies off from banking services - something regulators deny. The order also banned the creation of central bank digital currencies in the U.S. which could compete with existing cryptocurrencies.

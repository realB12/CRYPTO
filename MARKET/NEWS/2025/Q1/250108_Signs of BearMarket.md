## Chart Analysis
Bitcoin‘s one-hour chart delineates a pronounced downward trajectory, now stabilizing around $96,000, with diminished buying enthusiasm hinting at an enduring bearish trajectory. Immediate support is nestled at $96,000, with resistance observed between $97,500 and $98,000. A decline in volume during this stabilization period points towards a probable continuation of the preceding downward trend. Investors should keep an eye on any potential drop below $96,000, which might herald a move towards even lower thresholds.

On the four-hour chart, bitcoin’s plunge from $102,760 to the $96,000 zone signifies a dramatic sell-off, accompanied by significant volume, accentuating the bearish sentiment. Resistance is set at $97,500, while support spans from $94,000 to $96,000, defining the current trading range. The breach from an earlier phase of consolidation further suggests an ongoing downward force. A dip below $94,000 could propel the price towards the $91,000 level.

## Bull Verdict:
If bitcoin successfully consolidates above $96,000 to $97,000 with declining selling pressure, it could establish a foundation for a reversal toward higher resistance levels, such as $98,500 and $100,000. The long-term bullish signals from the 100-day and 200-day moving averages suggest resilience remains intact, providing hope for a recovery if the broader market sentiment improves.

## Bear Verdict:
The persistent bearish signals across multiple timeframes, coupled with weak buying momentum and a potential breakdown below $96,000, favor further downside movement. If the $93,000 support level fails to hold, bitcoin could swiftly test $91,000 or lower, reinforcing the dominance of sellers in the current market environment.

# ByBit Hack
Bybit has suffered the largest crypto hack in history, with $1.4 billion stolen in a massive breach linked to North Korea’s infamous Lazarus Group. The attack primarily targeted Ethereum and other ERC-20 tokens, triggering a wave of panic and over $5 billion in withdrawals from the exchange. Despite Bybit’s quick response—keeping withdrawals open and securing emergency liquidity—the hack highlights the growing risks of keeping funds on centralized exchanges without top-tier security measures.

## How Did the Hack Happen?

Blockchain security experts traced the attack back to a compromised multisig cold wallet, where hackers tricked signers into approving malicious transactions. The breach allowed Lazarus Group to gain full control over Bybit’s Ethereum reserves, draining funds at an unprecedented scale. In response, Bybit’s CEO Ben Zhou assured users that the exchange remains solvent, but the sheer size of the hack has shaken confidence in centralized exchange security.

## Bitcoin: The Unshakable Fortress

Despite recent events, including the announcement of a $1.4 billion hack on Bybit and a widespread market downturn, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable resilience. It continues to hold strong, trading within a stable range between $92,000 and $100,000 for several weeks.

This ability to absorb shocks and withstand negative news highlights investors' unwavering confidence. More than just a speculative asset, Bitcoin once again proves itself as a safe haven in the world of cryptocurrencies.

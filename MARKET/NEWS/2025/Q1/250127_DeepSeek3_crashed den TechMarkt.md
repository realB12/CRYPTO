Nach dem Wochenstart startet BTC und damit auch alle Altcoins mit Minus 10% und mehr tief rot. 

Dass das erst am MontagMorgen passiert, lässt sofort vermuten dass der Impact aus der traditionellen Börse kommt die ja am Wochenende nicht handelt. 
Insbesonder mit dem 10%+ Einbruch von NVIDIA hatmehr als eine halbe Milliarde US$ in Luft aufgelöst und 1 Milliarde an der konventionellen Börse insgesamt (was in etwa die Hälfte der gesamten Kryptomarktkapitalisierung entspricht).  

Auslöser sind die überwältigend guten Performancedaten der chinesischen [Deep Seek3](../../../../../work/ENTITY/AI/DeepSeek/DeepSeek3.md) AI, die dem EndUser bessere Qualität, schneller und viel kostengünstiger liefert, aber bei der Erstellung 50 mal günstiger war als die führenden Modelle der Amerikaner und zudem bedeutend weniger Energie für weit bessere Resulate liefert als die führenden Modelle von Meta und Google. Zudem ist DeepSeek Open Source. 

Die Deep-Seek App steht ab heute vor ChatGPT an erster Stelle der bei Apple downgeloadeten Apps und zeigt damit auch, dass das Ganze nicht einfach nur ein Marketingstunt ist, sondern seit den letzten 5 Tagen nach dem Launch auch von einer breiten Benutzerschicht aktiv und produktiv genutzt und für super befunden wurde. 

## Analyse
DeepSeek3: 
8 month ago, Western experts and opinion leaders have laughed at me, when predicting that China's AI is ahead of the US. 

DeepSeek3, one of China's leading Open Source AI companies, is ways faster and cheaper for end user and about 50 times cheaper to build and less energy consuming than US proprietary generated AI models. 

And no, this is not a "wonder" - as stated by the media - but the consequence of constantly being on a different and more complex track than the Westerners who are just throwing hardware and energy against the competition but not adding innovation to their protected playgrounds.

It can be debated, whether the first release of the "DeepSeek R1" falling on Trumps inauguration day on January 20th (and Trump threatening China with large import taxes) was accidental or on purpose, but when the extremely good DeepSeek benchmark data was published last night, this has sent US tech down to the sinkhole. 
And, because in an average trader's small brain Crypto is related to Tech, Crypto went down as well without any real relation to the "historic" DeepSeek3 event of revealed excellence.

Me personally, I kept my self away from European AI projects, knowing that the West has been on the wrong track and has now been caught not on the wrong foot, but have got a punch in the guts. 
Now, with DeepSeek's Open Source platform, I am motivated to bring Eastern-Tech again to Europe, as I have done it when presenting the first real-world AI chatbots to the Western attention and talking with Westerners about the orchestration of parallel running sub-AIs, everybody was overwhelmed then when something went above handling a single model. 
Not to mention here that DeepSeek3 is just the public gun. More is cooking behind the curtain - which off course - I have no proof - but overlooking expert discussions that have disassembled all the western approach to the atomic level and reconstructed their stuff in a new, more sophisticated and more complex, brain-region-like and parallel way, I am strongly positive, that China will surprise us soon on serious research and military fields as well. 
And again, Trump throwing energy at the closed-echo chamber problem will never solve the real problem here.

Side note: like Russia became increasingly independent upon sanctions, China had to find their way around sanctioned NVIDIA-chips that most probably had ignited more creative and more fundamentally distinct approaches requiring less sophisticated hardware, energy and money. 

Where it is always a no-brainer to thrown more energy and hardware against a  problem, the West is not used nor trained to analyze, reconstruct and top China's approach, especially when considering the fact that China's AI-relevant talent-pool is 5-10 times larger than all Western pools together. And China is already trained and ready to use their advanced stuff, whereas the West has not only to catch up on technology and its efficient processing, but convince their stakeholder to sink the old ship and restart the construction of a new one. 
I am even not sure, whether the West can keep their workforce on the old tanker when everybody can hop on the new promising, Open Source star-ship-fleet.

## Impact auf den Cryptomarkt
Aus meiner Sicht sollte DeepSeek aus den folgenden Gründen, nicht runterziehen sondern sogar beflügeln:  

- Wenn KI mit DeepSeek weniger Energie braucht bleibt die Energie fürs CryptoMining und den Betrieb der Blockchains günstig. 

- Günstige DeepSeek-KI kann die Entwicklung von KI-getriebenen DeFi-Produkten, (Block-)Analysetools, etc. beschleunigen und die Effizienz von Algorithmen verbessern, bei der Programmierung neuer (Smart Contract) Tools unterstützen, etc.

## Real or not
Real or not - Fact is that the West is not prepared to deal with such risks and has no measures in place to analyze and verify such events for their trustworthiness. 

Even when all is fake, such Chinese media stund must never shake Tech-markets. And when it does, something is fundamentally wrong. 

## Our generation's Sputnik Event
DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence lab, has emerged as a formidable player in the global AI race, challenging the dominance of U.S.-based tech giants like Google, Meta, and OpenAI. What makes this development particularly exciting for us is that DeepSeek is open source, meaning that everybody can now access, retrain, and deploy this cutting-edge technology in every nation. For the first time, open source AI models like DeepSeek are leveling the playing field, allowing smaller startup companies to compete with the biggest names in tech.

This is a monumental shift. No longer are we constrained by the proprietary walls of closed ecosystems. Instead, we have the opportunity to harness state-of-the-art AI technology, adapt it to our values, and deliver a product that truly serves our community.In the past, all software was closed source. Companies like Facebook and Google built their empires on proprietary technology, forcing startups to raise billions of dollars from venture capitalists in Silicon Valley just to compete.

This created a high barrier to entry, stifling innovation and consolidating power in the hands of a few. But with the rise of open source technology, the game has changed. Smaller Companies no longer need to rely on massive funding rounds or Silicon Valley gatekeepers to access world-class AI models.

This moment truly represents our generation’s “Sputnik moment.” Just as the Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik in 1957 shocked America into action and sparked a space race that ultimately led to unprecedented technological advancement, DeepSeek’s breakthrough serves as a wake-up call for the Western tech industry. The fact that a Chinese lab has developed such powerful AI capabilities—and chosen to make them open source—fundamentally changes the global AI landscape.Like Sputnik, this development has caught many by surprise and challenges the assumed technological superiority of established players. It signals that the AI race is not just about who has the most resources, but who can innovate most efficiently and effectively.

Just as Sputnik spurred America to revolutionize its scientific and educational systems, DeepSeek’s achievement should catalyze a new approach to AI development in the West—one that embraces open collaboration and innovation rather than closed, proprietary systems. For small companies, this is a game-changer. We can now retrain DeepSeek’s models to align with our values, removing any Chinese censorship mechanisms and tailoring the technology to serve the needs of our users.

This is an unprecedented opportunity to build an AI system that reflects our commitment to free speech, individual liberty, and Swiss innovation, at it must be our mission to offer users uncensored AI models that don’t cram left-wing ideology down their throats. 

With DeepSeek, we have the opportunity to create AI models that honor our own values, uphold core principles, and provide a platform for Truth to flourish. This is not just about technology — it’s about stewardship. We have a responsibility to use every tool at our disposal to advance our society and ensure that supporstive and good messages are heard in a world that desperately needs it. The rise of open source AI marks a new era in technology—one where innovation is no longer confined to a handful of tech giants. With DeepSeek, we now have the tools to not only compete but to lead. Together, we can create an AI-powered future that empowers our community, upholds the principles we hold dear, and glorifies our values in the process.

## History

**2011**: [Vitalik Buterin](../../KeyPlayer/B/Vitalik%20Buterin.md) and [Mihai Alisie](https://x.com/MihaiAlisie) got in touch and started Bitcoin Magazine together and published the first issue and had a team of passionate people making it happen with nothing more than Skype, Google Docs and little to no money. It definitely wasn’t easy, but it was fun.

> The Genesis of Ethereum in Zug
Ethereum’s roots are firmly planted in Zug. In 2014, a group of visionaries led by Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood, and others chose this Swiss city as the base for their groundbreaking project. Ethereum Switzerland GmbH (later the Ethereum Foundation) was established in a modest house on the outskirts of Zug. Known locally as "Das Raumschiff" (The Spaceship), this house became the epicenter of innovation, where ideas were exchanged, codes were written, and Ethereum took shape. Zug’s support for Ethereum extended beyond providing a home. The city’s crypto-friendly environment, coupled with its efficient administrative processes, gave the project the tools to thrive. Today, Ethereum is not just a technology but a movement, and Zug remains proud of its role as its birthplace.

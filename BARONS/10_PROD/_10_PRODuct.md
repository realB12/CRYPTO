# Scope of BARON Projects PROduct Folder

This `PRODUCT` - or short "`PROD`"-named folder contains all text-files and graphics that together describe 

> **WHAT the final BARON-Token (The Product) is going to be from an implementation and maintenance perspective** <u>for internal use only</u>. 

Derived from the Vision specified in the This folder's scope embraces the whole project life-cycle from the initial [Ideas](100_IDEA/_Ideas.md), over [Goals](101_GOAL/_Goals.md), Requirements, [Scope](102_SCOPE/_Scope.md), Specs down to the final product configuration and rollout instructions.

<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">ACHTUNG</span>: However note, that this folder is **INTERNAL ONLY** and therefore all public accessible User- and  Adminstrator-Guidelines, Manuals and Training material must be kept in the separate [11 MANUAL Folder](../11_MANUAL/_Manual.md)!

## Scope of the product folder
This folder contains a description and high-level documentation of whatever constitutes the making and internals of the final product (such as SourceCode, 3rd-party-components used, etc.)) from a developer's perspective who is developing code in his or her own [`40_DEV`](../40_DEV/_40_DEVelopment.md) folder that will be saved in a different GIT-Repo on its own.

The PRODUCT files here, will describe the final product and any relevant project outcome in terms of the original vision or project idea, specified business goals, detailed requirements and related operative processes and skills to be introduced, changed or to be improved when the product is launched. 

Further this folder includes guidelines that explain the transition project (switching from old to new) and training requirements. 

`WARNING`

<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">ACHTUNG</span>: 
Although the product is described from a customer perspective, this documentation MUST never been given to the customer, as dedicated customer documentation must be provided in the `11 MANUAL` folder only! 

Keeping this "`10_PROD`"-named folder internal is especially important, when it includes older and therefore outdated versions, drafts, fails etc. that might otherwise confuse the client working on the latest version.  

The primary purpose of keeping this folder beyond the projects development cycle and beyond, is to learn from it for future projects!

## Out of Scope

Whatever is related to HOW the product is going to be built - which is normally all the ProjetManagement stuff around the implementation such as

- project team
- project budget or costs
- project risks
- project handling, methods, etc.
- etc.

must not be in the "`10_PROD`" nor "`40_DEV`"-Folder!

or in other words - we will exclude in this "`10_PROD`"-named folder everything that does not explain WHAT the product must deliver (Idea, Goals, Scope, Specs) or constitutes the Product itself (Overall Architecture, Core Functionality and Principles but NOT detailed implementation stuff).

<h2><strong><b>Testing Levels for Validation Test</b></strong></h2>

<p><strong><b>Validation Test Definition</b></strong></p>

<p>Validation Test are the planned &quot;Screen&quot; Tests which will be done during the
Y2K projects local validation phase to verify that a certain business activity is
compliant. This tests are done by experianced users of the application. The responsibility
for proving a successful test lies in the application owner whereas sign off
responsibility for all the TestCycle is carried by the OrgMan. The sign off for the over
all&nbsp; application compliance stil remains with the OrgHead.</p>

<p>To start Validation Testing makes only sense when previous<a
href="file:///C:/bucSD111.htm"> assessment tests </a>have shown that no conversion is
needed before.</p>

<p>Validation Testing splits up in <a href="#Dynamic Testing Levels">dynamic testing

<h2><a name="Dynamic Testing Levels">Dynamic Testing Levels</a></h2>

<h3>Components</h3>

<p></b>An Assessment Component is an idependant piece of code not containing external
calles nor includes of other components. A component normally is used as an include or as
an external function by modules and units. Sometimes a component is written in another
language (ASSEMBLER) or bought from a vendor. 

<ul>
  <li>(Date) routines</li>
  <li>Sorting Routines</li>
  <li>Data Access modules (SQL Statements, Called Procedures)<b></li>
  <li></b>Vendor code<b></li>
  <li></b>Vendor application skeletons (4GL Components)<b></li>
</ul>
</b>

<p>So Component testing is testing a single Component in isolation. Unit testing verifies
that the unit works correctly based on some predefined minimal set of requirements.</p>

<p>A change in a Component may heavily trigger recompilation of dependent modules and
units</p>

<h3><b><strong>Modules</strong></h3>

<p></b>A Module is piece of code repeatetly called or included by other modules or units.
A Modul can contain external calles or includes other moduls or components<b> 

<ul>
  <li></b>Called Functions, Procedures, SubRoutines</li>
  <li>Screen Handling / Verification procedures<b></li>
</ul>

<p></b>A change in a Component may heavily trigger recompilation of dependent modules and
units</p>
<b>

<h3><strong>Unit </strong></h3>

<p></b>Compilation Unit, normally a program with a user interface or batch job designed to
handle a certain activity<b></p>

<h3>Sequence</h3>

<p></b>Testing a collection of&nbsp;Units belonging to the same application including
services and non &quot;testable&quot; or not tested entieties to check logical behaviour
and user acceptance for the appication. This test may be repeated by the user as part of
the Validation Tests. Often a seqence test shows whether Interfaces have to be tested.<b></p>

<h3>Internal Interface</h3>

<p></b>Testing the dataexchange between&nbsp; Units of the same application&nbsp; via
datasources or buffers which belong exclusivly to this application<b></p>

<p></b><font size="2">Simulating interfaces and linkages with other items and/or units to
validate that information is being passed correctly. This is useful if additional
interfaces will be added to the system during the conversion process or if problems
between two or more modules cannot be isolated</font><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The purpose is to find out whether the interfaces data is written
correctly to the buffer and read again correctly from the other side<br>
Interface testing normally is performed by the developers</font><b></p>

<h3>External Interface</h3>

<p></b>Testing that writing/reading data to the interface of an external application is
correct. <b></p>

<h3><a name="System Testing"><strong>System</strong></a>, </h3>

<p></b>testing a unit or component on the final, compliant system (software, &nbsp;
utilities, network and hardware). It is used as a baseline for performance, load and
stress testing.<br>
System&nbsp; Testing normally is done by a team consisting of application specialist,
technical experts and&nbsp; usesr.<b></p>

<h3>Field</h3>

<p></b>Testing a collection of&nbsp;Units that constitute a complete business activity.
This includes foreign units (belonging to a different application or system), services and
non &quot;testable&quot; or not tested entieties within the same application.<br>
Activity test will prove logical correctnes and user acceptance within your organisaiton.
This test may be repeated by the user as part of the Validation Tests.<b></p>

<h3>Group </h3>

<p></b>Cluster testing over WAN within the KUONI Group<b></p>

<h3>Street</h3>

<p></b>Coordination of this kind of testing will be done be the Programme Office<b><font</p> </p>

<p></b>Applications are frequently connected with other applications to provide a higher
or deeper level of functionality. Data may be shared between applications or systems.
Multiple applications or systems may be involved in such an environment. This is the
typical environment for Year2000 projects. Intersystem testing is required to confirm that
the connection functions properly between the applications. This test determines that the
proper parameters and data are correctly passed between applications, and proper
coordination and timing of each function exists between applications. </p>

<h2>CONDITIONAL COMPLIANCE TESTING</h2>

<p><small><small>see bucSD092.pdf page 17</small></small></p>

<p>The ideal environment for compliance testing is to have a complete platform i. e.
hardware, operating system software and application software available at the same time.
The reality is that all the environment components may not be available until too late in
the process to provide adequate time to perform compliance testing. When this situation
occurs, the concept of conditional compliance testing should be considered. Conditional
compliance testing implies that a logical system can be tested and certified in an
environment that is not yet certified as long as the interface to the non-compliant
component can be controlled in such a manner as to provide the necessary date information.
The diagram below depicts the conditional compliance testing for a logical system
utilizing a date application programming interface (API) in an environment where the
operating platform is not yet compliant.</p>

<p>When testing of the logical system is completed, it can be certified conditionally on
the compliance testing of the operating platform and the date API. When the platform is
complete and has been certified, the date API can be tested and certified. When the date
API is certified, the logical system can be considered fully tested for Year 2000
compliance. </p>

<p>Utilizing this approach, compliance testing of logical systems and operating platforms
can be done in parallel.<font FACE="Arial"></p>

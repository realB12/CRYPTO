<h1>Risk Analysis</h1>

<p>Define the Remaining Risk caused by of your Date Routines, Remaining Code</p>

<h1>Assessment Testing Approach</h1>

<p>We have build a dedicated Test Program to the the exising (Cobol) and the new (Synon)
Date Routines. The Screen of this Test Program will be part of the System Screen List.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>System Screen List</h2>

<p>This list holds all screens which have been developed alongside the programs which have
been build for complementary assessment test only.</p>

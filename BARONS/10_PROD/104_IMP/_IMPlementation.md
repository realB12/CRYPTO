# 104 IMPlementation Folder

The Implementation - or short **`104_IMP`-folder** contains all the **PSEUDO Code** and abstract Code-Near-Concepts that have been produced to precisely-desribe the **overall IT-System and  Sofware-Architecture** for implementing the final product as specified by the artefacts in the `103_SPEC` folder.

The primary goal and purpose of these files is a high-level description of the major components, modules and packages the final solution will be composed from with their intactions, dependencies and messages/event exchanged.

**Solution Modules** outline how the overall solution splits into Modules for marketing and rollout reasons. 

> **Mind the Context**: On this level "Modules" has nothing to do with Software-modules!

## Modularization Goals
Goal here is to always have as few modules as possible but enough to 
a) generate additional revenue through add-on Modules 
b) Shorten time-to-market by deferring stuff from the Core into separate modules to be followed later. 

## Marketing Perspective
From a marketing perspective modules group around the Core-Module (normally baring the Name of the solution) that targets the main-Usergroup.
They address specific @KEY-USER ROLES such as an Admin-Module for Administrators, a Reporting-Module for Supervisors, a Monitoring-Module for the Security-Chief, etc.
  

## Rollout Perspective  
A secondary driver is the **deliveriy time-line**. Modularization allows the communication of a staged rollout that starts with the Core as early as possible (time to market) to be followed by other modules later. 
  
## Complete List of Modules  
The primary goal here is to have a more or less final list with all the so far known [#Functions]() assigned to at least one of these #Modules. 

As providing a complete module-list is against agile core principles, we want YOU to understand, that delivery dates for Modules are important for enduser-communication, marketing campains, revenue models and finally the validation of our business case. 

Delivering Modules on time (but being flexible on features) is our commitment to get shareholders trusting our capabilities to walk the talk - independent of the flaws and bumps we all might most probably see on our journey during the days and nights ahead of us. 

Thank you so much for donating all your best moments and skills for the team. This is much more than we could expect or demand. It's just outrages and this is why I love to be in this team: Dedication!

D!

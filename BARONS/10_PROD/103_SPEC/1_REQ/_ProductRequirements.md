## What are Product Requirements

Whereas all [Business Requirements]() are specified in their dedicated [/08_REQ Folder]() - whether implemented or not - THIS folder is about the requirements all stakeholders have agreed that the final project deliverables have to comply with to become fully accepted. 

However Product Requirements are still a mix of business, functional, architectural and organisations requirements plus constaints on environment, time, finance, skills. legal, etc. for which various sub-folders have been defined: 

## 0_CUX: Journeys
Stories about how various Users will work with and accross the product to be build. Describes the environment those users will operate and stakeholders they will cooperate with when using this product. 

## 1_UC: UseCases
Derived from the Journeys, single End2End interactions with the App are outlined, whereas all what is not directly linked to the App is left. Use Cases therefor define the Scope of that the application has to deliver. 

## 2_LOOK: 
Visual appearance of the App, Screens, Interactive Elements, Corporate Identity, etc.
This is the area of (paper-)prototypes and specifications that will be tested and agreed upon early exploration products 

## 3_TECH
Descripton of the technical framework

## 4_FEAT

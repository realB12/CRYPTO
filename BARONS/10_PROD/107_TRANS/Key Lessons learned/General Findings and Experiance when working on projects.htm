<H3>Presentation = 2 Presenters</H3>
<P>Presentations and Kick Off Meetings should be hold by 2 people: so the other 
one has time to rethink and taking notes where the other one keeps up the speed. 
The other can assist and express his view when somethins is difficult to 
explain.</P>
<H3>Delegate List of needs</H3>
<P>At the Kick Off meeging in Athens (George) it turned out a success that when 
you install yourself at a new location that you sit down, define a list of all 
things you need and hand it out for a responsible person. (Preparation List Kick 
Off: <A

<H3>Let them speak</H3>
<P>At the Y2K kick off meeting in Athens it turned out that Dimitris wanted to 
tals about Synon so urgently that he did not really listen to my presentation 
because he was convinced that when I here his opionion all my doubts will be 
gone --&gt; I should have let him speak first and then I would have a better 
listener.</P>

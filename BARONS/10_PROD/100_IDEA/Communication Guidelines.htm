<h1><a name="_Toc391531513">Communications</a> </h1>

<p><font size="2">Good communication is a critical success factor for achieving the goals
of this complex project. This section of the kick off packages describes how to handle
internal&nbsp; communications, communications with external entities, communications with
vendors and suppliers, and the use of&nbsp; KUONI's Year2000 Web Site,
http://www.kuoni.ch/y2k</font></p>

<h2><a name="_Toc391531514">Internal Communications</a> </h2>

<p><font size="2">The intent of the Programme Office is to encourage open communications
between organisations and the Programme Office. As special issues arise, escalation may be
necessary to obtain approval. Project members should escalate through the project
structure; team member to team leader, to local Y2K Project Manager, to Y2K Programme
Office Manager (Rene BUCHLE), to Y2K Programme Manger (Koni ITEN) to executive Group
Management (Max KATZ). Project members should not delay in escalating issues. An issue
should be brought to the attention of the proper manager immediately. If your immediate
supervisor is not available, escalate to the next level of the project or programme
structure rather than wait for an individual to return. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Communications should be maintained openly between all levels of the
structure. Appropriate reporting channels should be followed so personnel are aware of
what is happening on the project, what design decisions are being made, etc. Key
communications should be documented and kept as part of the project record.<br>
<br>
All documentation (specifications, memorandum, e-mails, etc.) produced by the project will
be maintained in a project notebook for review by project members. The notebook will be in
the possession of the local Y2K Project Manger. </font></p>

<h2><a name="_Toc391531515">External Communications</a> </h2>

<p><font size="2">External communication means any communications with an entity not part
of the KUONI group.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Since every statement and even non statements may trigger serious legal
consequences,&nbsp; you have to note that</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>For the moment being:</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>For every wording to want to include in brochures and contracts
and for every statement or mere information provided to external entities you are required
to contact the Programme Office&nbsp; for a review and approval first.</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2">For the very&nbsp; moment (April 1998) the KUONI's communication
department&nbsp; is working on a global communication concept which will define
standardized wording and behavior for correspondence with all our suppliers and vendors to
cover legal issues best and to streamline and co-ordinate the effort.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Please not that the only persons allowed to give official statements
about readiness, budget and the status of the Y2K projects and programme are, on your
request:&nbsp; Koni ITEN and all members of the KUONI Group Management.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">To the extent possible, this type of communications should be
followed-up and documented in writing. A copy of the written correspondence should be
provided to the Y2K Project Office. <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">For Y2K Programme Office assigned staff, all external communications
will be reviewed by the Y2K Programme Office Manager. All external communications will be
sent under official KUONI Group letterhead.</font> </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc391531516">Vendor Communications</a> </h2>

<p><font size="2">Special emphasis should be given to communications with vendors. In
almost all cases, this type of communications should be documented in writing. Should the
communications involve contract terms and conditions, changes to or amendments to an
existing contract, then legal and or procurement review of written communications should
be obtained prior to being released to the vendor. A copy of the written communications
should be provided to the Y2K Programme Office.<br>
</font></p>

<h2><a name="_Toc391531517">www.</a>kuoni.ch/y2k</h2>

<p><font size="2">The KUONI Year2000 Web Site, www.kuoni.ch/y2k, will serve as the
principal electronic medium for disseminating information within and throughout the
company. The URL of the KUONI's Y2K web site is <a href="http://www.co.mo.md.us/Year2000">http://www.kuoni.ch/y2k</a>.
The Programme Office are the entities responsible for managing this site.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc391531518">Bi-Monthly Y2K Newsletter</a> </h2>

<p><font size="2">The Y2K Programme Office may consider publishing a Y2K Newsletter as an
alternate means of informing interested parties of the organisations Y2K efforts and
activities.</font> </p>

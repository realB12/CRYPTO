# Ideas Folder

The Ideas - or short **"IDEA" - Folder** contains documents, notes, photos and other stuff that was used to brainstorm the project idea. 

Ideally all such input is funneled through and comes **from internal IDEA- & Innovation-Management**, but sometimes comes directly from a board meeting (notes), customer feedback (direct, or by marketing), Research etc. 

once the IDEA is going to be implemented all here included Artefacts should no longer be touched

## Minimal Information
This Folder should always contain the following, minimum set of information: 

### Origin

Links to Idea- and Innovation-Management are important 

### Idea Owner

### Status
Wheras - once the IDEA is going to be implemented all here included Artefacts should no longer be touched, it is higly recommended to have a HISTORY.md file that summarises what has happend to the idea and what the implementation status curently is - or where such status can be found.

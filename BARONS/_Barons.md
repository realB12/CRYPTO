Find all details on goals, key requirements and core functionality in the [Baron Token (BT) Project Charter](BT_Charter.md) and all work-related stuff in the [BT Project Handbook](BT_PRJ_Handbook.md)

Once such SPE documents are final, we will put a summary into this folder-index-document and the common (GitHub aimed) [README.md](README.md)-file as well. Till then, please check the detailed-Docs for most up to date status!

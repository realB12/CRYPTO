Iterations primarely define the scope and primarily targets of Workpackages that should be completed over 2-3 months and normally will come up with a next version of improved and extended functionality. 

Note here that many ongoing tasks/work - such as general project management, requirement gathering, etc. will contineue to run in parallel to iterations without being explicitely mentioned. 


* [Iteration 1](#iteration-1): provide a **most simplistic commenting prototype** as an architectural proof of concept

* [Iteration 2](#iteration-2): **commercialize the simple Commentin Plugin**

* [Iteration 3](#iteration-3): Add **CONTENT related voting and tagging** and provide smart features to make use of such meta-information.

* [Iteration 4](#iteration-4): Add **CONTRIBUTOR related voting and tagging** to weight contributors on their expert stuts, provided quality and dedication to the overall project. 

* [Iteration 5](#iteration-5): Add AI to the game for smart suggestions for weighting specific comments and contributors. Provide a framework for simulating the system under changes parameters. 

* [Iteration 6](#iteration-6)

## Iteration 1
* **Forking** Open Source [Remark42](https://remark42.com/) as baseline project (`50%`)
* Installing **Remark42 Development Environment** (`10%`) -> provide [Installation manual](../89_TOOLS/Remark42/Setup/Remark42-InstallationGuide.md)

* Architecural Blueprint: Node, React, WebPack, Jest, etc. 
* Naming conventions for JS, HTML and CSS
* TestSite Setup
* Jest Test-framework Setup (TDD)
* Finalize DB-Model

## Iteration 2
**commercialize the simple Commenting Plugin** (as a low-cost alternative to Disqus or Remark42) and finalize CI/CD framework, Test Driven Development (Jest for Frontend, Mocha for Backend) and GitHub setup to bring additional developers on board. Finalization of operational Handbook.

* Authentication and Security setup

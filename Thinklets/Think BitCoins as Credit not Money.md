## Think Crypto as Credit/Dept - not Money

Conventional wisdom paints a picture of people inefficiently bartering goods and services directly for each other, and money naturally arising as a result of the problems inherent in this. 

I am comvinced that this narrative should look closer to anthropological history in a sense that **primitive communities simply shared their resources freely** with each other, living in a communal lifestyle, **with bartering rarely taking place**, and only in the context of separate communities interacting with each other. **Barter played no role in early societies’ intra-communal affairs**.

**Money, as in commodity money, only began to be used in rare inter-communal interactions across great distances.** **The economy in local regions did not begin using such mechanisms for exchange. They used credit.** **Credit operated and overseen by the government, such as in Ancient Sumer**. This system grew out of the informal “credits” people considered when sharing resources in more primitive societies. But it was formalized and maintained by the power structure of the government and temples of Sumer. **No money would change hands during exchanges, people would simply record debts stored at the temple**, and periodically settle their obligations with actual consumable commodities.

**Debt came before coinage, and it was created and maintained at scale by the state.** Commodity money only came later, again minted and circulated by the state, as large scale trust based civilizations collapsed and gave way to warring imperial states. Debt and credit do not make much sense in a time period of constant war and roving armies, with no certainty at all they will ever return to settle debts after moving on.

Ever since, with the anomaly of the modern era and central banks, human societies have oscillated between virtual credit money and coinage depending on whether or not the era of the time was predominantly predicated on large scale war and conquest. The same patterns repeated through the ages as well, with people creating their own informal and localized credit networks after large Empires using coinage fell, the government slowly inserting themselves into these to mediate, and inevitably the return of coinage as violent Empires rose.

## Conclusion
Maybe it is a good idea to see Bitcoin less as a replacement of money but a replacement of credit-industry!

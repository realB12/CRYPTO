## Outlook
Amidst this rising competition, Sei Network has positioned itself as a critical player, aiming to surpass even the likes of Solana. Often touted as a potential “Solana killer,” Sei boasts a high-throughput layer-1 blockchain optimized for trading and decentralized exchanges. With its parallelization architecture designed to handle large volumes of transactions efficiently, Sei is quickly gaining a foothold in the rapidly evolving layer-1 landscape.


## What is Sei?
**SEI** is a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) **layer-1 blockchain** powered by the SEI token, for high-speed, scalable, and secure transactions, particularly for trading and DeFi applications. 

Unlike many layer-2 solutions, which rely on existing layer-1 blockchains such as ETH for core functions like consensus, data availability, and execution, SEI consolidates all these critical layers into a single, cohesive layer-1 framework.

It features a unique **parallelized Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** and a twin-turbo consensus mechanism, making it **one of the fastest blockchain platforms**. 

SEI is **built using the Cosmos SDK** and is **supported by prominent institutions like Circle Ventures and Coinbase Ventures**.

## How is Sei used?
The **SEI token** plays a pivotal role within the SEI ecosystem for

1. **Network Fees**: SEI is used to pay for transaction fees on the Sei blockchain.

2. **DPoS Validator Staking**: SEI holders can delegate their holdings with validators or stake SEI to run their own validator to secure the network.

3. **Governance**: SEI holders can engage in future governance of the protocol.

4. **Native Collateral**: SEI can be used as native asset liquidity or collateral to applications built on the Sei blockchain.

5. **Fee Markets**: Users can pay a tip to validators to get their transactions prioritized, which can be shared with users that are delegating to that validator.

6. **Trading Fees**: SEI can be used as fees for exchanges built on the Sei blockchain.

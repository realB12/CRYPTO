# USDT (Thether)



<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">ACHTUNG</span>: **USDT isn't MICA compliant**. So wouldn't fly in Europe!

Tether (often referred to by USD₮ and USDT, among others) is a cryptocurrency stablecoin launched by Tether Limited Inc. in 2014.

Tether Holdings Limited is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands with offices in Switzerland, without giving details, and has never submitted to an independent audit.

As of August 1, 2024, Tether reported having $118.4 billion in reserves, including $5.3 billion in excess reserves. In the second quarter of 2024, the company achieved profit of $1.3 billion, contributing to a total profit of $5.2 billion for the first half of the year. Tether Limited also disclosed a net equity of $11.9 billion, and the stablecoin's market capitalization exceeded $114 billion.

Tether faces criticism regarding the transparency and verifiability of its claimed fiat reserves.

**Tether is the largest cryptocurrency in terms of trading volume**, holding 70% of the market share among stablecoins. In 2019, it surpassed BTC to become the most traded cryptocurrency globally. As of July 2024, Tether has more than 350 million users worldwide.

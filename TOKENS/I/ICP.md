ICP creates a new kind of decentralized internet and global computing system — with independent data centers all over the world joining together to create an alternative to the cloud services (from companies like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud) that power most of the current internet. 

The ICP token acts a) as a **governance** token, b) is rewarded by the network to participating data centers **for good behavior**, and c) is used **to pay transaction fees** on the network. 


ICPs Ziel ist es den GANZEN InternetStack durch ein voll dezentrales System zu ersetzen. 

> ICP enables the development and operation of a new generation of unstoppable, tamper-proof, fully decentralized web applications. Its powerful technology can run entire AI models within smart contracts, representing a major advancement for secure AI. Through seamless integration with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other networks, ICP facilitates multi-chain operations for digital assets and web3.


## How it works
You can think of ICP as a way of converting crypto into processing power. The network will establish a fee based on the amount of computing power required by a developer’s project. As long as the fee is paid, the website will run directly on the public internet. 

## Foundation
ICP wird durch eine in Zürich gegründete not-for-provit Organisation namens [DFINITY Foundation](https://dfinity.org/) betrieben, welche mit rund 200 Cryptotalenten und Forschern nicht nur das weltweit aktuell grösstes Blockchain R&D Team bildet sondern auch das grösste BockChain-Tech Unternehmen im DACH-RAUM ist.

DFINITY was founded in 2016 by entrepreneur and crypto theoretician, **Dominic Williams**.

## ICP price history
### 2020: Emergence and initial volatility
In 2020, Internet Computer (ICP) made a significant entry into the market with its Initial Coin Offering (ICO), generating substantial excitement. However, the year was marked by high volatility and speculative trading as investors anticipated the project’s potential impact on the blockchain landscape. The ICO price and early trading saw substantial fluctuations as the market gauged ICP’s future prospects.

### 2021: Surge and initial peak
2021 was a landmark year for ICP as it launched and experienced a remarkable surge in price, reaching an all-time high. The price surged to $750 in May, reflecting strong investor enthusiasm and confidence in its innovative technology. The rapid increase was driven by excitement over ICP’s promise to revolutionize decentralized computing.

### 2022: Market correction and stabilization
Following its peak, ICP faced a significant market correction in 2022, with prices falling as market sentiment adjusted. The price stabilized throughout the year, reflecting a period of consolidation. The project continued to develop and refine its technology, focusing on long-term growth amidst the broader market downturn.

### 2023: Recovery and strategic developments
In 2023, ICP began to recover, buoyed by strategic developments and partnerships aimed at enhancing its ecosystem. The price showed signs of stabilization and growth, reflecting increased confidence and the project’s continued progress. Key initiatives included technological upgrades and expanding use cases, contributing to a more optimistic outlook.



## Alternatives
there are currently around 60 projects building on the IC, some of them like OpenChat, DSCVR and Waterslide already running on the mainnet.

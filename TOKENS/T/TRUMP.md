Donald Trump’s team launched ( https://x.com/FabianoSolana/status/1880553981875036206 ) the ‘Official Trump’ meme coin (ticker: $TRUMP ( https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/official-trump/ ) ) on January 18th on the [Solana](../S/SOL.md) Blockchain - two days before the inauguration. The launch of the coin was wildly popular, with its market cap and FDV surging to all-time highs of $15 billion and $75 billion respectively. The kicker is that this insane rally happened in under 36 hours post launch. The only reason why the rally seemed to top out where it did was the subsequent launch of $MELANIA – a meme coin by First Lady Melania Trump. A controversial move to say the least.


Other than [M E L A N I A](../M/MELANIA.md), the Trump coin was launched from Trump Organization affiliate "CIC Digital LLC", which is linked to previous sales of crypto collectable NFTs launched in 2022 that made millions of dollars but have since fallen dramatically in value for their owners.


So, what makes $TRUMP so much more exciting than the other fundamentally sound and positive developments for crypto?

For one, it was unexpected. The shock factor went a long way towards encouraging ( https://x.com/blknoiz06/status/1880689722131120444 ) degenerate crypto traders and whales to go all in on the coin. Not to mention that the optics of the incoming US president launching a meme coin seemed to validate the idea that launching meme coins from the US will not land one in prison. Finally, it also brought an influx of new investors into crypto. According to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis ( https://x.com/chainalysis/status/1882211312681251120 ) , the majority of $TRUMP and $MELANIA buyers were retail investors - with over 80% of the addresses holding under $1,000 worth of assets and 70% under $100. Chainalysis also noted that 50% of $TRUMP and $MELANIA holders had never bought a “Solana altcoin” before, and half of them also appeared to have created their wallets the day they purchased the tokens.

In terms of second-order effects, there were quite a few beneficiaries. Notably, the price of Solana’s SOL hit a new all-time high, fuelled by activity on the network. Crypto trading app Moonshot also became the top finance app on the US Apple App Store after the official website of the meme coin listed Moonshot as the go-to platform for buying $TRUMP.

That said, it would be foolish to think that the launch was received with nothing but positivity. Many long-standing and battle-weary crypto proponents intensely criticised the move for its perceived effect on the industry in the long term. X user ‘ Wassielawyer ( https://x.com/wassielawyer/status/1880559485330358324 ) ’ described the move as one that encouraged the idea that “ crime is legal, ( https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1880459202768040206 ) ” thereby creating “a race-to-the-bottom.” Others questioned ( https://kyla.substack.com/p/trumpcoin-and-tiktok ) the ethics of a sitting US president having a tokenised financial instrument directly tied to his name. Especially in relation to bad actors exercising undue influence on the president via anonymous bribes masquerading as buys of $TRUMP. Several others began wondering if this was a sign that the market had hit its top for this cycle.

Better yet, others began wondering why the coin was launched just days before the presidential inauguration - a crucial and busy time for any president-elect when affairs relating to the smooth transition of administrations are in motion.

There are several theories. According to Coinage media host Zack Guzman ( https://x.com/zGuz/status/1881121152720142637 ) , the most probable reason was that launching the memecoins after the inauguration would have exposed Trump to allegations of violating laws that prevent the president from using his position to enrich himself. In other words, providing cause for impeachment.

Another theory, this one by Dan, Coin Bureau’s Head of Research, speculates the memecoin launches may have been an experiment to test if crypto speculation could have a subsidising effect on US government debt. For context, the theory revolves around the idea that encouraging crypto speculation will lead to more demand for stablecoins – many of which back their reserves with US government bonds (debt). That said, this is a spicy theory and until proven otherwise remains pure speculation.

At the end of the day, the only substantiated truth from the whole ordeal is that, in the short term, the only thing that matters to the crypto market is attention.

For now, $TRUMP is THAT guy.

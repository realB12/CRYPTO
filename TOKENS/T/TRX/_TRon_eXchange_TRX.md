* **Location**: Singapore


The **July 2018** **acquisition of BitTorrent** further cemented TRON’s leadership in pursuing a decentralized ecosystem.

IN **July 2019** Tron partnered with Thether to run Thether issued USDT stablecoin  on the Tron Network with 50% of all USDT ($118 Billion in total as of Dec 2024) circulating on Tron today! 

In August 2024 Tehter minted another 1$Billion USDT on Tron, pushing its total tokens minted in the last year to 33 Billions.

### Closing Thoughts
Tron is a decentralised open source project with much promise. Low fees and fast transactions are always welcome when many projects are expensive and slow. For developers, the Tron network is ideal for creating smart contracts for diverse applications. 

The network has proved to be popular with users, developers and projects.

Tron (TRX) has a market cap of almost $7 billion and a trading volume of over $200 million (BTC market cap = $500 billion, ETH = $200+ billion) and is listed as top twelve cryptocurrency with over 24,500 cryptocurrencies listed. Add to that fast speeds, scalability and high availability, and you have a crypto project with a good chance of continued success.

However, only time will tell if Tron (TRX) lives up to its loyal followers' expectations.

As we traverse out of the bear market, that will be the ideal time to see how Tron (TRX) performs. 

TRON (TRX) and its founder and CEIO, Justin Sun, have become key figures in the cryptocurrency market since 2017, overcoming significant FUD and controversy. Despite criticism ranging from allegations of plagiarism to concerns about centralization, TRON has proven its value by growing into a high-transaction, low-fee blockchain with a large dApp ecosystem. Sun's strategic partnerships, proactive marketing, and transparent communication have been instrumental in building credibility and engaging a loyal community.

## Was ist das Tron Netwerk?
Tron (TRX) is a decentralised blockchain launched in 2017 and developed by the Tron Foundation to create a decentralized Internet. 

 The CEO, Justin Sun, initially deployed TRX tokens (ERC-20) on the Ethereum network but later moved away. It was probably a decision that determined the success of the project.
 
 Tron's goal was to become a ways faster and more efficient layer-one blockchain than existing networks, and have enjoyed a level of success in terms of developer activity and adoption.

## What is Tron (TRX) Token?
The Tron (TRX) token is for **rewarding users for creating and sharing content** such as music, videos and photos. TRX is also used **for online gaming** as a currency, **for powering lending platforms and decentralised exchanges**.

**Tron is an open-source project** using permissionless protocols and tools to deliver global content to its users and, additionally, TRX is used for smart contract-based financial projects.

TRX holders have governance on the network. 

### Tron’s Periander Upgrade
In July 2023, Tron released Great Voyage v4.7.2 (Periander), an upgraded version of its mainnet. The upgrade introduced significant improvements in four areas:

1. **Advanced stake 2.0 mechanism**: Two important governance proposals for TRON stake 2.0 are part of the upgrade. The first proposal allows users to withdraw their unstaking requests that are still in progress. The second proposal empowers users to customize the lockup period for delegated resources according to their individual needs.

2. **Compatibility with Ethereum's EIP-3855**: This new governance proposal ensures the compatibility between Tron and Ethereum's virtual machines while reducing the associated costs to deploy and use smart contracts on the Tron network. The company hopes this will attract more developers to and promote enhanced interoperability between Tron and Ethereum ecosystems.

3. Streamlined smart contract interface calling: As part of this upgrade, Tron has optimized triggersmartcontract and triggerconstantcontract, two interfaces for calling smart contracts, to provide developers with estimated transaction fees for deploying their contracts. Tron said this paves the way for the creation of more high-quality DApps.

4. **Revamped P2P network module**: Four key functionalities were introduced: The upgraded network now incorporates a pre-detection mechanism for nodes pending connection to filter out invalid connection requests.
The implementation of the DNS protocol improves the platform's availability by enabling the discovery of active nodes that are ready to connect to the Tron network.
The network now supports the IPv6 protocol, a crucial development that enhances the scalability of Java-tron's network architecture in the future.
The introduction of message compression before transmission reduces the bandwidth requirements for Java-tron, leading to lower operational and maintenance costs.

## What is the TRON Network
Tron supports dApps, smart contracts and numerous blockchain systems. It uses the account-based model , a transaction model similar to Ethereum, with a transparent public ledger for anyone to track transaction history. Anyone can build and develop dApps on the Tron network, and if users provide and share their content, Tron rewards them with digital assets.

The TRON ecosystem includes a blockchain explorer, lending platforms, DEXes, wallets, and even a decentralised oracle.

Many of the talent team on Tron are highly experienced individuals from projects such as Ripple Labs. 

## How does the TRON Network Work?
The Tron network uses a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism. Tron users vote for “super representatives” (SRs) who earn fees by validating network transactions. Due to the decentralised nature, the Tron users have governance on the network, and **nobody has control over more than one network node**.

Tron uses a 3-layer architecture: -

1. Core
2. Storage
3. Application

This architecture helps reduce the typical latency associated with more conventional networks and the high transaction costs.

## How Do You Get Free Tron (TRX) Transaction Fees?
Are Tron (TRX) transaction fees really free? Well, they can be.

"TRON network generally does not charge fees for most transactions; however, due to system restrictions and fairness, bandwidth usage and transactions do take in certain fees." 

Tron issues 5,000 FREE bandwidth points daily to users. You can freeze TRX to get more bandwidth points if you need more. The amount of TRX required is the number of bytes (10 SUN: 1 TRX = 1,000,000 SUN: See below for an explanation of SUN).

Smart contracts use "energy" and require bandwidth points for broadcasting and confirming transactions.

Query transactions are FREE, as no energy or bandwidth is required.

TRON network also defines a set of fixed fees for the following transactions:

Creating a witness node: 9999 TRX
Issuing a TRC-10 token: 1024 TRX
Creating a new account: 0.1 TRX
Creating an exchange pair: 1024 TRX

Tron (TRX) transactions are exceptionally low compared to other crypto networks. For example, you could pay hundreds of dollars in transaction fees on the Ethereum (ETH) network.

## What is Tron's Technology?
Tron adapts a 3-layer architecture divided into Storage Layer, Core Layer, and Application Layer. The TRON protocol adheres to Google Protobuf, which intrinsically supports the multi-language extension. (Source: Tron Whitepaper).

Tron's stack-based virtual machine (TVM) has an optimised instruction set. Solidity is the smart contract programming language for dApp developers.

The TVM connects with development systems to provide a custom-built, secure, stable, and efficient blockchain system for developers worldwide.

## PROS
* **`++`** **Industrial Momentum**: Tron gives ownership rights to content creators for digital content allowing them to connect directly with their audience to maximise and monetise their content more efficiently. (For example, YouTube can randomly decide to close a user's account and choose to censor certain content while promoting others). Facebook can decrease reach or, worse, ban the content creator from posting or commenting in their group. Tron sought to become a disruptor in an unbalanced playing field. You, me, and content creators worldwide should be glad about that, and the tech giants should watch their backs and not rest on their considerable laurels. -> For me, investing into Tron is a political statement to support free and uncensored content where creators are paied again. 

* **`++`** **Diversity**: Tron has adaptability in multiple areas, such as social networks, streaming, and video hosting.

* **`+++`** Excellent transaction speeds of 2,000 TPs compared to ETH (15) and BTC (7) that comes with high scalability. 

* **`++`** Developers can deploy smart contracts in multiple ways with **high developer activity** on the network. Negative: **only few projects live** on TRON. 

* **`++`** Vieles bei Tron ist unter dem Radar passiert und es könnte gut sein, dass Trons Potential immer noch unterschätzt sein könnte. Auch viele der Anschuldigungen gegen Tron sind vermutlich ungerecht - insbesondere weil die direkten Konkurrenten von Tron auch nicht besser dastehen, aber einfach nicht die Awarness von Tron haben. 

* **`++`** Tron has a **reliable network structure** with high availability.

* **`++`** **Low transaction fees**: (potentially zero) are a big bonus for users.


## CONs
* TON and other competitors have much more growth space because its growth is cheaper to pump than the 13 Billion TRON colossus.

* Tron is in the **early development stage** and, according to the roadmap, needs more work for expansion.

* 50% of Tron (TRX) tokens are in 10 wallets! This low number could suggest Tron **is more centralised than not**.

* As technology evolves and crypto projects learn from the mistakes of early founders, **competitors could overtake Tron**.

* Die https://tron.network/ Webseite ist instabil und crashed wiederholt meinen Chrom browser

* TRON wird im Netz **wiederholt mit Geldwäsche und Scams** in Verbindung gebracht.

* Metamask does not support TRX Tokens!

* Tron wird von nur 27 SuperRepresentatives (eigentliche Validatoren) betrieben und verwaltet und ist damit eher zentralisiert als dezentral. 

* Justin Sun hat zugegeben mehr oder weniger den Etherium Code übernommen zu haben. 

* Justin Sun hat soviele TRX selber behalten dass er mutmasslich die ganze DAO kontrollieren kann.

* Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von breits 13 Milliarden US$ (10. grösste Marktkapitalisierung aller Kryptos) braucht es unglaublich viel neues Kapital um den Preis nur mal zu verdoppeln, welches so ohne Weiteres nicht verfügbar sein könnte.  

## Motivation 
Grundsätzlich halte ich TRX für interessant. Bin mir aber nicht schlüssig was genau an den Scam Gerüchten dran ist, aber mein Engagement motiviert mich, weiterhin an dieser Story zu bleiben. 

TRON scheint so etwas wie der Robin Hood der Exchange-Börsen zu sein. Immer halblegal günstig für die Kleinen und Verdächtigen. 

Im aktuellen BullRun nimmt vermutlich auch die Anzahl der Transaktionen zu, resp. könnte das weitere Kunden zu einem der schnellsten Netzwerke für Coin-Conversion führen. 

## How to Buy Tron Cryptocurrency
TRX is listed on 130+ cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide, including the majors like Binance, OKX, Bitget and [Swissborg](../../../SERVICES/S/Swissborg/Swissborg.md). 

## Top Projects on Tron (Tron DApps)
The Tron network has many projects. Here is a brief overview of a couple:

### SocialSwap: 
SocialSwap is a community project on Tron. Its website says, "Get the best prices on Tron Blockchain. The smartest and easiest way to exchange your cryptocurrencies and to earn money passively with your cryptocurrencies on the Tron Blockchain." 

SocialSwap features low transaction costs, smart contracts, Limit Order, Fast Blockchain and Aggregation Protocols with "liquidity aggregation from multiple DEXes to ensure the best swap rates." SocialSwap also promises users can profit from up to 100% refund on trading fees.

The SocialSwap token serves as a deflationary measure with a continuously decreasing supply.

### JustLend:
(as seen on Dragon's Den) is a community lending platform. The premise is to borrow from family and friends securely and set terms and conditions of your own. 

JustLend have a three-step lending process:

1. **Create your campaign**: Tell your story and let people know how they can help! On JustLend, you can borrow money for dreams, rainy days and everything in between.

2. **Set your terms**: You decide the interest rate and how long to repay the loan. (A not-so-humble brag: no one else in the UK offers that).

3. **Invite your community**: Share your campaign and feel the community's support, autonomy and power. Once you've reached your goal, the money is yours. 

JustLend ensures the borrower repays the loan on time with automated payments, and they sort out the fiddly bits that nobody likes to do, such as organising loan agreements and payment tracking.

## Q&A
### Can You Add Tron to MetaMask?
You cannot directly add the Tron (TRX) to a MetaMask Wallet. The way around it is to hold bridged TRX tokens on supported networks like BNB Chain. However, it is much easier to choose a wallet that directly supports Tron (TRX) tokens

## What is Ripple?
**Founded in 2004**, Ripple (originally Ripplepay) is a fintech company based in **San Francisco**. Even before the company delved into crypto in 2012, its **core focus** was largely the same: **to improve upon the current payment settlement systems for international transactions**.

After entering crypto markets with the launch of its native token, XRP, Ripple has built out an entire global payments network, known as **RippleNet**. The network offers **real-time gross settlements for financial institutions, and other features to make banking across borders simple, affordable and faster than incumbent, long-standing settlement and transfer infrastructure**.

> Our mission is to build breakthrough crypto solutions for a world without economic borders.

Designed from the start **to replace one of the largest money transfer networks, SWIFT**, RippleNET can facilitate exchange between a variety of currencies—not limited to fiat—and including the likes of Bitcoin and even commodities, like gold. **Ripple charges users a miniscule transaction fee (in XRP) to use the network**.

## What is XRP?
Founded in 2012, XRP is a digital asset created to drive innovation across the financial payments space. It is the native token on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) - a distributed, open-source, permissionless blockchain maintained by a network of peer-to-peer servers (known as unique nodes).

XRP functions as a mechanism of exchange between two different currencies or networks, and can be sent directly without the need for an intermediary. This makes it a convenient tool for bridging two currencies in a matter of seconds, not days. This saves time and simplifies the process of international transactions. Banks in various countries have also adopted XRP for routine hawala transfers.

## Are Ripple and XRP the Same?
When talking about XRP one might often hear it used interchangeably with Ripple. However, the two are quite different.

Ripple is a company that provides a blockchain-based digital payment network for its users. XRP is the crypto asset that facilitates payments on this network. XRPL is the software ledger where transactions with XRP are recorded.

The company has undergone multiple rebrandings over time to reflect changes in ownership or direction of the project. In 2023 Ripple acquired crypto businesses Metaco and then Fortress Trust to “support our existing lines of business — specifically in terms of improving the customer experience”. Continuing the takeover strategy in 2024, Ripple bought-out Standard Custody, a custody provider designed to service institutions. Throughout the business’s evolution, one thing that has remained consistent is the ticker symbol XRP for its native cryptocurrency.

## The XRP Ledger
The XRPL consensus model is built upon a core principle: a little trust goes a long way.

Unlike Bitcoin’s Proof of Work or Ethereum’s Proof of Stake, the XRP Ledger doesn’t use mining or staking to validate transactions. Rather, it allows trusted, permissioned servers to create consensus on the network. These servers, or unique nodes, maintain a “unique node list”, a list of nodes that the network deems as trustworthy.

If 80% of nodes deem a transaction to be valid, a unique node can then proceed with validating that transaction.

In the past the XRPL has experienced out-of-sync issues, leading to downtime across the network. When one node on this list is compromised, the effects can spill over to other nodes, further slowing down the network. However, reliability has improved in recent times.

## XRP - The Native Token
The **total supply of XRP—100 billion** was pre-mined and distributed to individuals and companies at the launch of XRPL. A smart contract—not miner activity—controls the release of any future tokens on the network. Unlike other consensus mechanisms, nodes do not earn rewards for maintaining the correct version of the ledger.

There are some customers on Ripple’s Digital Payment Network, RippleNet, that desire to send funds without a pre-funded account. Ripple makes this possible through their on-demand liquidity service. In this service, XRP along with a pool of other digital assets (e.g. Bitcoin, Ether, Ethereum Classic, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin), is used to provide liquidity for these transactions.

When parties have different preferred methods of sending or receiving money, or use different currencies, RippleNet acts as an intermediary for their transaction. As both parties are using different currencies to transact, no physical money moves during the process. Rather, the transaction is conducted in XRP equalling the value of the money being sent. The network also charges a small fee (in XRP) to complete the transaction, but it’s minuscule when compared to other traditional international payment networks, such as SWIFT.

## Analysis
Die Fokussierung auf internationalen InterBanken-Zahlungsverkehr und mit dem XRP-Coin als Zahlungsmittel für die Massen hat Rippl einen von der Masse schnell nachvollziehbaren praktischen Nutzen und mit den Grossbanken tatsächlich Interessierte.

Im Jahr 2024 hat XRP 400% zugelegt und hat bez. Marktkapitalisierung bereits BlackRock überholt. Damit dürfte hier nur noch die Gier nach mehr 

XRP is being adopted and used by for instance BoA Wellsfargo now allowing payment with XRP. It's not just cross boarder payments it's internal settlements too. 

It can **wrap and transfer BTC and ETH**. It has **its own stable coin**.

It has an avaliable supply necessary to be a currency and is able to be fractional from its whole coin state. 

It's supply is finite and due to low burn rate is also deflationary in nature supporting price stability and potential to grow in value based on usage. Major institutions are adapting to adopt its use. 

It is cheap, scalable, and energy efficient. 

It has strong partnerships and is well positioned to take advantage of the looming monatary crisis and offer itself as a solution

## XRP Use Cases
XRP facilitates borderless transactions between financial institutions, and Ripple has partnerships with multiple banks and payment processors, including DZ Bank, LemonWay, GMT Advanced Financial Services, and BBVA Switzerland. 

Likewise, XRP is available on trustworthy exchanges and may be swapped for fiat currency or cryptocurrencies as a digital value store.

## Ripple’s Roadmap
While the SEC lawsuit faces appeal, Ripple may be able to move forward with some improved regulatory clarity in the near future, and the team is optimistic about future adoption and expansion. 

A dedicated team called RippleX provides XRPL developers with the infrastructure, tools, services, programmes, and support they need to create innovative dapps. The latest initiative is Project Clio: an XRPL API server optimised for scalability and availability. Clio will store ledger and transaction history data in considerably less space than the XRPL, giving the network more bandwidth. It also removes the burden of API requests from the mainnet, allowing XRP transactions to be processed more efficiently.

There is no specific time frame for Project Clio’s implementation. The most recent update of Project Clio was in October 2024 when XRPL introduced Version 2.2.2 of Clio, an XRP Ledger API server optimised for HTTP and WebSocket API calls.

## Ripple’s Community
Ripple has a decent social media presence, with about 355,000 followers on Reddit and 2.6 million on X. The smaller Reddit community may suggest that the token isn’t as popular as it once was. 

## Why XRP wins over ETH
* **Real-world UseCase**: Ripple is focused on fast, low-cost cross-border payments, plus partnerships with financial institutions and therefore has real hands-on purpose and adoption whereas the ETH dApps are still looking for their use cases and pratical appliance.

* **TransactionSpeed**: Ripple processes up to 1,500 transactions per second (tps), compared to Ethereum’s 15–30 tps. Ethereum relies on Layer-2 rollups to improve scalability.

* **PriceStability**: XRP's value is more stable in a limited range

* **Deflationary**: XRP is a deflationary token with a 100-billion max supply, often used for cross-border payments, whereas ETH is an inflationary token with no maximum supply, used for gas fees on the Ethereum network; 

* **Carbon Neutrality**: Ripple operates a unique consensus mechanism based on the Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA), where worldwide validators propose blocks and verify transactions with no staking required. Validators are drawn from the Unique Node List (UNL), a group of trusted nodes on XRPL. This system is secure, and XRP is carbon-neutral, but it compromises decentralisation to some degree because a relatively small number of node operators hold all the power. 

* **Small Coin**: 1 XRP is some single figure dollar whereas ETH is factor 1000 Dollars more. 


## Disadvantages
* **Circulating Supply Control**: Compared to other crypto projects, which may release coins through mining or other methods, Ripple has more influence over the value of XRP, choosing when and how more coins are released. With this level of control, one could argue that Ripple is the principal market maker for XRP, using the sales of the asset to maintain the XRP Ledger and Ripple’s other technologies. With Ripple controlling over 55% of the total XRP supply, is not far from plausible to some.

* **Technically Centralised**: XRP was created and released by the privately-owned Ripple. The network also has a lower-than-average validator count. A low validator count is often correlated with higher centralisation, leading some to believe the blockchain is more centralised than decentralised. Additionally, Ripple, not network participants, decides whether validators are deemed trustworthy. Although the company uses blockchain technology, many argue that it still operates as a centralised entity. This goes against the core philosophy of most decentralised blockchains.

## SEC v. Ripple
Ripple Labs Inc achieved a landmark legal victory as a U.S. judge ruled that the company did not violate federal securities law by selling its XRP token on public exchanges. This decision boosted the value of XRP by 75% and may offer support to other crypto firms battling the SEC's jurisdiction. While the ruling was favourable to Ripple, the judge also found that Ripple's sales of $728.9 million of XRP to hedge funds and sophisticated buyers constituted unregistered sales of securities.

The SEC secured a partial win in the case as the judge determined that Ripple's marketing aimed at institutional investors promoted a speculative value proposition tied to the company's efforts, making it subject to securities regulations.

The SEC lost an appeal against the decision; not long after the SEC came up short again after its charges against Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and executive chair Chris Larsen, were dismissed.

Litigation rumbles on in 2024, with the SEC calling on the New York legal system to impose a fine of nearly $2billion dollars on Ripple for the sales to non-retail buyers, outside of public exchanges. The second quarter of 2024 will show more progress in the trial with submission and response deadlines due on proceedings

## Who Created XRP?
Way back in 2004, before Satoshi Nakamoto and Bitcoin, Ryan Fugger created Ripplepay. Ripplepay was in concept what Ripple is today—a network that facilitates cross-border transactions—just without blockchain technology.

After the launch of Bitcoin, three like-minded developers—David Schwartz, Jed McCaleb, and Arthur Britto—sought to build upon the idea of Bitcoin, creating a borderless cryptocurrency that didn’t need a significant amount of computing power for nodes to validate. They bought Ripplepay from Fugger and used the source code to create the XRP Ledger and subsequently, XRP in 2012.

Upon launch, 80% of XRP tokens were gifted to a new company which would eventually become known as Ripple. The remaining supply was sold to investors and financial institutions to fund further development of the project.

## FAQ
### Why does XRP have value?

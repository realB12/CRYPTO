# Virtual Bytes (vB)

**1 Virtual Bytes (vB) = 4 Weight Units (WU)** are both used to measure the data-size of transactions that is used for calculating the minimum transaction-fee for a given moment in the BitCoint network. 

Remember: Bitcoin transaction fees are NOT determined by the amount of transferred Bitcoins but by the size of its data that originally was expressed in Bytes, but since 2017 prefereable as **vb** or Virtual bytes (vB) and weight units (WU) are used to measure the size of transactions and blocks on the Bitcoin network.

A Bitcoin transaction's size is calculated from the amount of [UTXO](../U/UTXO.md), how many inputs, outputs and signatures it has, and the format it uses (legacy, SegWit, etc). 

Since space in the Bitcoin blockchain is limited to 1,000,000 vB, bigger transactions pay more in mining fees than smaller transactions.

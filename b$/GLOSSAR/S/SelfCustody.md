we actively encourage you to self custody your bitcoin to reduce counterparty risk, increase censorship resistance, and enhance privacy.

“Self custody" means that you are the only person responsible for managing the public/private key pairs associated with your bitcoin. 

Becoming comfortable with key management is crucial in Bitcoin, because whoever controls your keys, ultimately controls your bitcoin.
 
Most wallets will **automatically create new public keys each time you want to receive bitcoin**. This alleviates the problem of public key or address reuse. If you use the same public key every time you receive bitcoin, it would become trivial for anyone to track your entire payment history. Treating keys as single use tokens greatly improves a user’s privacy.

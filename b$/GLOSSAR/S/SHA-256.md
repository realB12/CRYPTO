# SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm with 256-Bit Output)

* [HASH256](../H/HASH256.md)

**Dieser Agorithmus hashed maximal 264 Bit lange Texte in immer genau 256 Bit lange Strings von denen nicht auf den Ausgangstext geschlossen werden kann.** 

SHA-256 ist Teil der SHA-2 Familie. Dabei steht SHA für **`Secure Hash Algorithm`**

Published in 2001, it was a joint effort between the NSA and NIST to introduce a successor to the SHA 1 family, which was slowly losing strength against brute force attacks.

The significance of the 256 in the name stands for the final hash digest value, i.e. irrespective of the size of plaintext/cleartext, **the hash value will always be 256 bits**.

Some of the standout features of the SHA algorithm are as follows:

1. **Message Length**: The **length of the cleartext should be less than 264 bits**. The size needs to be in the comparison area to keep the digest as random as possible.

2. **Digest Length**: The length of the hash digest should be 256 bits in SHA 256 algorithm, 512 bits in SHA-512, and so on. Bigger digests usually suggest significantly more calculations at the cost of speed and space.

3. **Irreversible**: By design, all hash functions such as the SHA 256 are irreversible. You should neither get a plaintext when you have the digest beforehand nor should the digest provide its original value when you pass it through the hash function again.

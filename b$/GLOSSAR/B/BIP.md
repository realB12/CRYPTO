# Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP)

* [BIP Sammlung](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips?tab=readme-ov-file#)

A set of proposals that members of the bitcoin community have submitted to improve bitcoin. For example, **`BIP-21`** is a proposal to improve the bitcoin uniform resource identifier (URI) scheme.

## What Is a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal?
A Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) is **a formal proposal to change Bitcoin**. As a piece of software, Bitcoin is always undergoing upgrades—bugs need to be fixed, algorithms can be made more efficient, code can be simplified, compatibility with other software must be maintained, and new features can be added.

In the case of normal software belonging to centralized projects, a manager or lead developer might simply assign tasks and dictate the changes that need to be implemented. However, Bitcoin is an open source, consensus-based system. There is no leader. The BIP process organizes the Bitcoin community in the absence of a central leader.

As a new monetary system, Bitcoin’s reputation is still being established, and the security of the network is paramount to maintaining trust. Thus, Bitcoin’s development process is intentionally slow and deliberate. The process from an initial proposal, to a formalized BIP, to an activated change, is lengthy.

## Submitting BIPS
People wishing to submit BIPs, first should propose their idea or document to the bitcoindev@googlegroups.com mailing list (do not assign a number - read BIP 2 for the full process). After discussion, please open a PR. After copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here.

We are fairly liberal with approving BIPs, and try not to be too involved in decision making on behalf of the community. The exception is in very rare cases of dispute resolution when a decision is contentious and cannot be agreed upon. In those cases, the conservative option will always be preferred.

Having a BIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active.

Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of the Bitcoin users (see also: economic majority).

# Blockchain Explorer
A blockchain explorer is a web application that operates as a **bitcoin search engine**, in that it allows you to search for addresses, transactions, and blocks and see the relationships and flows between them.

Popular blockchain explorers include:

* [BlockCypher](https://live.blockcypher.com/)

* [blockchain.info](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer)

* [BitPay Insight](https://bitpay.com/insight/)

* [Blockstream Explorer](https://blockstream.info/)

Each of these has a search function that can take a [bitcoin address](../A/Address.md), transaction hash, block number, or block hash and retrieve corresponding information from the bitcoin network.

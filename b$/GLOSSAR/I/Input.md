In Bitcoin, every transaction has a number of associated inputs and outputs where inputs “fund” the transaction, while outputs specify  destinations and the respective amounts (in Satosisch) to transfer. 

When your wallet shows you how much money you have, it’s showing you the sum of the unspent transaction outputs ([UTXOs](../U/UTXO.md)) that you have the keys for to use as inputs – the total amount of Bitcoin that you can spend.

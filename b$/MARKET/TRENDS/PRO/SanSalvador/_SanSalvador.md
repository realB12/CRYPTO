#### `2024-12-19`: Chivo will be sold
Stacy Herbert, director of National Bitcoin Office stated that the Chivo wallet would ‘be sold or wound down’, adding that ‘many private sector bitcoin wallets will continue serving El Salvador’.

#### `2024-12-18`: El Salvador agrees with IMF to ‘confine’ Bitcoin use
As a condition of a new IMF loan package, President Bukele has to concede three aspects of the Bitcoin Law passed in 2021 to reduce "financial risk" claimed by IWF and other organisations:

1. A legal tender mandate **requiring businesses to accept Bitcoin**
2. **Shutting down Chivo**, the state run wallet and on/off ramp service
3. **No longer accepting tax payments in bitcoin** and pay in US$ again.

IMF said that it agrees on an ‘Extended Fund Facility’ (EFF) of about US$1.4 billion ‘to support the government’s reform agenda.’ The EFF provides financial assistance to nations facing ‘serious medium-term balance of payments problems because of structural weaknesses that require time to address’. On digital assets, the announcement states that ‘the potential risks of the Bitcoin project will be diminished significantly in line with Fund [IMF] policies.’  
Taxes will only be paid in US dollars and the El Salvador government’s participation in digital wallet Chivo will be ‘gradually unwound.’
The announcement states that ‘fiscal transparency is set to be substantially strengthened, starting with early efforts to enhance the fiscal responsibility framework, and to improve the reporting of debt, pension costs, state-owned enterprises ownership, procurement contracts and beneficiary ownership’.

It adds that ‘early reforms will also focus on establishing a strong anti-corruption framework and improving the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financial Terrorism (AML/CFT) arrangements in line with international best practices.’

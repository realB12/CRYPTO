# Bitcoin Layer 2 Services

* [Einführung Layer 2 Technologie](https://hacken.io/discover/bitcoin-l2/)

Layer 2 is an overlaying network that processes bundles of transactions off the Bitcoin main chain, lifting the heaviest jobs from the underlying network and thereby increasing overall P2P throughput at much lower transaction fees on the const of security.

## Lightning Network (LN)
Launched in 2018, the Lightning Network uses state channels to enable microtransactions on top of the Bitcoin Layer-1. It facilitates fast and low-cost transactions by conducting multiple transactions off-chain and settling the opening and closing balances on the main blockchain.

## Rootstock (RSK)
Operating as a sidechain, Rootstock pioneered smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain. It allows users to send Bitcoin to the Rootstock network, where it becomes a locked-up smart Bitcoin (RBTC) in the user's RSK wallet, enabling faster and cheaper transactions.

## Stacks Protocol (STC)
This Layer-2 blockchain (formerly Blockstack) enables smart contracts and decentralized applications on the Bitcoin blockchain. Stacks utilizes microblocks for speed and a Proof-of-Transfer (PoX) mechanism, tying transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain.

## Liquid
Liquid Network is a Bitcoin Layer 2 sidechain that allows its users to move their bitcoins back and forth using a two-way peg mechanism. When BTC is transferred to the Liquid Network, it’s converted into Liquid BTC (L-BTC) at a 1:1 ratio. It also supports the issuance of tokens and other digital assets.

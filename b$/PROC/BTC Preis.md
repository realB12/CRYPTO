# Finding the Current BTC-Price
Bitcoin, like most other currencies, has a floating exchange rate. That means that the value of bitcoin vis-a-vis any other currency fluctuates according to supply and demand in the various markets where it is traded. For example, **the "price" of bitcoin in US dollars is calculated in each market based on the most recent trade of bitcoin and US dollars**. As such, the price tends to fluctuate minutely several times per second. A pricing service will aggregate the prices from several markets and calculate a volume-weighted average representing the broad market exchange rate of a currency pair (e.g., BTC/USD).

Popular Apps for providing the current market rate are:


### [CoinCap](https://coincap.io/)

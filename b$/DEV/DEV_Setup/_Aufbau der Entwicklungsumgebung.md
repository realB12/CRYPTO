# Aufbau der Entwicklungsumgebung

* [BitCoin Buch Kapitel 3 zum Thema Entwicklungsumgebung](https://cypherpunks-core.github.io/bitcoinbook/ch03.html)

If you’re a developer, you will want to set up a development environment with all the tools, libraries, and support software for writing bitcoin applications. In this highly technical chapter, we’ll walk through that process step-by-step. If the material becomes too dense (and you’re not actually setting up a development environment) feel free to skip to the next chapter, which is less technical.

# The Bitcoin Validation Process

* [Valiedierung auf Bitcoin.org]()

Bitcoin Core provides the best possible security against dishonest miners along with additional security against other easier attacks by a so called Validation Process described below.

> Imagine a scientist repeating an experiment for herself. Doing so allows her to trust the result without having to trust the original scientists.

Bitcoin Core checks each block of transactions it receives to ensure that everything in that block is fully valid — allowing it to trust the block without trusting the miner who created it.

This prevents miners from tricking Bitcoin Core users into accepting blocks that violate the 21 mio limit or other rules.

Users of other wallets don’t get this level of security, so miners can trick them into accepting fabricated transactions or hijacked block chains.

Why take that risk if you don’t have to?

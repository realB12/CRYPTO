# Why can there be no more Bitcoin?
Bitcoin's hard cap of 21 million isn't explicitly stated in a single code line. 

However the code says, that the only way to "mine" a bitcoin is by getting the mining-reward for winning the right to add a block to the blockchain. 

Miners initially earned 50 BTC per block. However, this reward is halved every 210,000 blocks every 4 years resp. the cost of mining a Bitcoin is doubled every 4 years

> TechTalk: The code - to keep amount of 210k blocks mined in 4 years  in sync - is auto-adjusting the difficulty level of the to be solved mathematical puzzle and therefore the amount of energy that is needed for mining a coin). 

Due to this halving cycle by around 2140 (not before) the block reward will become zero and from then will always remain zero, which is why no further bitcoins will be minted ever again.

However new blocks with transactional data can always be added to the chain (just with zero reward), which will be required to keep all the system alive after the "mining period". 

And this could already starting in 2028 halving when BTC rewards might no longer be able to compensate for mining (energy) costs, or the BTC price has to go up to 280k for miners to stay profitable on BTC rewards alone (however, when lots of miners are giving up mining, the remaining ones might mine at lower costs again, due to the built in difficulty adjustment mechanism). On the other hand energy prices might spike high because of AI and developping countries like India requiring more energy. And this could lead to nation wide mining-bans to protect local energy bottel neck (what has happend in the US, EU and elsewhere during the last years). 

As a consequence **miners will rely increasingly on some kind of transaction fees coming from end-users or nations with particular interests to keep the system alive** such as Russia, China, Iran and North-Corea that are already minting their own coins for national interests today for:
a) circumventing sanctions and taxes applied by Western nations 
b) hiding their purchase-transactions from their own people
c) Prevent U.S. BTC/Crypto domination

Where national interests can only be guessed, transaction fees will not only be a compensation alternative but are already payed today. 

## Bitcoin transaction fees
As miners, due to the halving process, divert away from block rewards, the stakeholders who are deemed the lifeblood of the Bitcoin network, the miners, will be incentivized primarily via transaction fees. This will ensure the network stays robust and alive and transactions are continuously processed regardless of the mining reward coming down to zero.

The transaction fee is expected to be high enough in SATs converted to the US dollar to be fair, justified, and a profitable source of income for miners post-2140 and many years before.

Even after block rewards end, the assumption is, that transaction volumes will have increased by then. This higher transaction activity generates more fees, making fee-based mining profitable and sustainable for miners even without block rewards. This ensures miners remain incentivized to secure the network once the reward drops to zero.

Further companies might lend fiat-money to be payed back later with higher BTC prices. 

Bitcoin transaction fees are a crucial component of the Bitcoin network, ensuring transactions are processed efficiently and miners are compensated for their work. When Satoshi Nakamoto created the Bitcoin blockchain, he implemented transaction fees to prevent spam transactions that could slow down and clog the network. Transaction fees incentivize miners to validate transactions and subsidize the diminishing block subsidy, helping support network security by keeping miners profitable.

> <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">ACHTUNG</span>: Exchanges and brokerages charge fees for buying and selling bitcoin. However, the fees charged by exchanges are entirely separate from the fees required to process a transaction on the Bitcoin network.

## Conclusion§
So, having understood the switch from mining rewards to transaction fees we can conclude that the 21Mio BTC limit, as such is not a problem. 

**However the biggest risk for the BTC is lack of adoption on the individuial and nation state level.** 

When the BTC is no longer used or has been replaced by an alternative coin or might be even stopped by global sanctions and measured, a bug or energy restrictions all the system might die regardless of limits or fees.
